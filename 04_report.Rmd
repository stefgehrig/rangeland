## Data processing and description

All Diagnostic Framework (DF) variables were transformed to be on the same scale from 1 to 3. All variables which had already originally been coded as ordinal with response options 1, 2, 3 were not changed (the raw data can be browsed under <https://stefgehrig.shinyapps.io/TNC-NTRI/>), independent of the distribution of responses. Binary variables (response options 1, 2), however, were set from 1, 2 to 1, 3. Continuous variables (e.g., Number of actors, Change in population size, Economic heterogeneity, Mean annual rainfall, ...) were linearly transformed such that the minimum was 1 and the maximum was 3, **in current absence of any better coding rules**.

<p>Note that some of the Diagnostic Framework (DF) variables show no variation between villages in the sample. See Table \@ref(tab:sds) with means and standard deviations (SD) for each DF variable. Variables which show no variation are highlighted in <span style="color:#FF7F50">orange</span>.</p>

```{r sds}
color.me <- which(summary_tier3$SD == 0)
summary_tier3 %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = c(Mean, SD), ~round(.x,2))) %>% 
  kable(
    format = "html",
    caption = "Mean and SD for Tier 3 variables and their originally employed coding (before rescaling continuous and binary variables to also be in the range [1,3], see text).") %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  row_spec(color.me, background = "coral")
```

The highlighted variables with zero variation cannot contribute any information in correlational or explanatory analyses (e.g., for explaining village-level outcomes). So they are removed by default from those analyses.

In Figure \@ref(fig:radar), one radar plot per category of the diagnostic framework (Tier 1) and per village is shown. This descriptive overview allows to get a better sense of the variation we have and which DF variables and categories might be more fruitful to analyze in more depth. The reader is referred to Table \@ref(tab:sds) for interpreting the scores (i.e., what does a low value of 1 [minimum] and a high value of 3 [maximum] mean?).

### Follow-up on coding issues

For clarification, I will lay out the coding of some variables for which there have been questions or discussion in more detail.

- `GS7.2: Self sanctions`

    In the Code Group Manager table, the following coding scheme is described: 
    
        - 4.7.2.1 Self Sanctions: Graduated sanctions
        - 4.7.2.2 Self Sanctions: Non-graduated sanctions
        - 4.7.2.3 Self Sanctions: No sanctions
        
    The above coding was confirmed by Marjoy in an e-mail (2022-12-13, CC: Monique, Susan). This is equivalent to *higher* values meaning *less* sanctions and inconsistent with all other DF variables in `Governance Systems (GS)`. The coding will therefore be reversed before running analyses which summarise multiple DF variables or estimating associations with outcomes (see following sections). The original coding is, for now, however kept for descriptive analyses like in Table \@ref(tab:sds), Figure \@ref(fig:radar), or in the database stored at <https://stefgehrig.shinyapps.io/TNC-NTRI/>.

- `GS4.1: Rules-in-use`

    In the Code Group Manager table, the following coding scheme is described: 
    
        - 4.4.1.1 Grazing rules: Yes
        - 4.4.1.2 Grazing rules: No
        
    However, I was advised by Marjoy in an e-mail (2022-12-13, CC: Monique, Susan) that this is wrong had to be reversed, such that, contrary to the original documentation that was shared in the project team, a *higher* value instead means that rules are *in place*. So the corrected coding, mentioned by Majory, appears in the database, all analyses and also Table \@ref(tab:sds).


- `GS7.3: External sanctions`

    In the Code Group Manager table, the following coding scheme is described: 
    
        - 4.7.3.1 External sanctions: Yes
        - 4.7.3.2 External sanctions: No
        
    However, I was advised by Marjoy in an e-mail (2022-12-13, CC: Monique, Susan) that this is wrong had to be reversed, such that, contrary to the original documentation that was shared in the project team, a *higher* values instead means that sanctions are *in place*. So the corrected coding, mentioned by Majory, appears in the database, all analyses and also Table \@ref(tab:sds).


- `O2.3: Invasives`

    In the Code Group Manager table, the following coding scheme is described: 

        - 7.2.3.1 Invasives: Worsened
        - 7.2.3.2 Invasives: Remained the same
        - 7.2.3.3 Invasives: Improved
        
    The above coding was confirmed by Marjoy in an e-mail (2022-12-13, CC: Monique, Susan). Since here *higher* values mean *better* outcomes, this DF variable can be combined with the other DF outcome variables (`O1.1: Compliance`, `O2.1: Commons condition trend`) without any need for recoding.

## Bivariate associations

For an initial exploration, I only looked at specific bivariate associations between variables, driven by some of previously discussed research questions. A natural conceptual way to summarize the high dimensional data would be to create summary scores on the DF Tier 1 level, e.g., one score per village for `Actors (A)`, one score per village for `Governance Systems (GS)`, etc. However, **this is currently not straightforward and requires some input**. The problem is that all DF variables of one Tier 1 category must have a clear directionality (e.g., "higher values means better"), otherwise an additive summary score like the mean has no meaning. Such clear directionality can rather easily be imposed on the `Governance Systems (GS)` variables and the `Outcomes (O)` variables, for example, but less so on the `Actors (A)` or `Social, Economic, and Political Settings (S)` variables.

Therefore, for now I only created average scores for  `Governance Systems (GS)` and `Outcomes (O)` variables for each village (unweighted average), **after reversing the direction of the variable `GS7.2: Self sanctions`, such that higher values mean more and not less sanctions (see Table \@ref(tab:sds))**. Higher scores on `Governance Systems (GS)` can then be interpreted as more developed governance systems and higher scores on `Outcomes (O)` can be interpreted as better commons outcomes (as coded from the qualitative data).

Their association is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:scattergso).

```{r scattergso, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Scatter plot of village-level averages of scores in Governance Systems (GS) and Outcomes (O) variables. Pearson correlation coefficient is shown.', out.width="50%"}
include_graphics("outputs/scatter_gs_o.png")
```
<br>

A positive association is clearly indicated. We can also look at the correlations of `Governance Systems (GS)` and `Outcomes (O)` variables on a variable-by-variable basis, as in the correlation matrix in Figure \@ref(fig:corrgso).

```{r corrgso, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Pearson correlation coefficients between single Governance Systems (GS) and Outcomes (O) variables.', out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("outputs/corrm_gs_o.png")
```
<br>

The outcome variable `O2.3: Invasives` seems to be least strongly associated with the `Governance Systems (GS)` variables.

A natural follow-up question would be to see how these relationships look after adjusting for rainfall. We would probably expect that we gain certainty about the positive relationship between resource governance and commons outcomes when partialling out the effect of natural variation in climate between villages. Therefore, I residualized the three `Outcomes (O)` variables via a linear model with `ECO1.1: Rainfall patterns` (average of mean annual precipitation 2016-2020 in mm) as a predictor before correlating them with the `Governance Systems (GS)` variables again. Technically, this estimates a semi-partial correlation. Interestingly, the relationships get weaker, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:corrgso2).

```{r corrgso2, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Pearson correlation coefficients between single Governance Systems (GS) and Outcomes (O) variables, with the effect of rainfall on Outcomes (O) variables partialled out.', out.width="70%"}
include_graphics("outputs/corrm_gs_o_residualizedrain.png")
```
<br>

Digging a bit deeper, this seems to be because rainfall is strongly negatively correlated both with the `Governance Systems (GS)` and `Outcomes (O)` variables (see Figure \@ref(fig:allcorrs)). Therefore, it competes with `Governance Systems (GS)` in explaining variation in `Outcomes (O)` variables.

In a next step, the GIS-based measurements of land use practices are introduced. We estimate a factor change in bare ground and crop land, such that, for example, a value of 1 means that the proportion of village area which is bare ground/crop land did not change from the pre- to the post-period, whereas a value of 1.5 means that the proportion of village area which is bare ground or crop land increased by 50\%. This ratio is log-transformed, maintaining the interpretation that larger values signify an increase in bare ground or crop land, respectively.

There are no clear associations between average score in `Governance Systems (GS)` and the GIS-based outcome measures (Figure \@ref(fig:scattergis)).

```{r scattergis, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Scatter plot of village-level averages of scores in Governance Systems (GS) and GIS-based outcome measures. Pearson correlation coefficient is shown.', out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("outputs/scatter_gs_bare_crop.png")
```

How do the GIS-based outcome trend measures relate to the DF variable `O2.1: Commons condition trend`, which is coded from the qualitative data sources? Figure \@ref(fig:boxcommon) shows that there is no obvious association.

```{r boxcommon, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Box plot of the GIS-based outcome trend measures, stratified by village score for the variable O2.1: Commons condition trend.', out.width="60%"}
include_graphics("outputs/boxplots_commen_trend.png")
```

For completeness, I also show all pairwise correlations among all DF variables and GIS-based outcome trend measures in Figure \@ref(fig:allcorrs).

```{r allcorrs, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients among all DF variables and GIS-based outcome trend measures.', out.width="100%"}
include_graphics("outputs/corrm_all_lup.png")
```
<br>

This analysis so far is, except for the adjustment for rainfall in one of the analyses, purely bivariate, i.e., when looking at one pairwise relationship, we marginalize over the sample distribution in all other variables. Many other types analyses are of course possible where we look at relationships between variables, *conditional on other variables*. So when we get to more sophisticated modelling approaches or multivariate methods, this is exactly what will be done. The exploration so far might, however, give some inspiration in which directions we can or should go in the next steps.

<!-- ## Governance Systems (GS) dimensions -->

<!-- The `Governance Systems (GS)` category is among those for which there are (i) most DF variables, (ii) most between-village variation (see Figure \@ref(fig:radar) and (iii) most straightforward to aggregate, because for all DF variables a rather clear directionality from "worse" to "better" commons governance can be devised. It is also probably the most interesting predictor category of commons outcome variables and central to the possible research questions. Therefore, here I add further analyses on its internal structure with multivariate methods. That will also provide a basis for a decision how to aggregate the DF variables into one `Governance Systems (GS)` score. In the previous sections, this was simply done with an unweighted average, i.e., under the rule that each DF variables should contribute independently and equally to the score. -->
