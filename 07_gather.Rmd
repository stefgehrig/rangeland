In line with the comments received and discussions had (e-mail from Monique, 2023-08-05), here we are starting to collect and results, tables and figures which could make it into the main text or supplemental material (SM) of the manuscript that Monique et al. will be preparing. The previous delivery of results (my e-mail from 2023-07-24) contained a more diverse set of explorations and presentations, but at this stage, we are ready to zoom in again on the relevant paths of analysis to be pursued and a reduced set of ways to present the results. This helps to gain structure and reduce confusion.

\textcolor{red}{schau nochmal in den NTRI (!) report, das Word doc. Da sind viele wertvolle richtungen zu denken drin mit dem ganzen substantivem wissen Ã¼ber den Ort und so und den Fragen die sie analysieren.}

# Descriptive tables and figures

It would make sense to split the data we use in two "types" and also present them in that way, to be very clear to readers. The first type are those Diagnostic Framework (DF) variables that are constructed from interviews and focus groups and coded in binary / ordinal manner (and used as outcome or predictor). These are noisy measurements of underlying latent traits and that is also the way we treat them in the analysis. One way to present them (main text or SM) is for example Table \ref{tab:dfsum}, based on the DF in the version from @mcginnis_social-ecological_2014. I'd suggest to only present the DF variables which actually use for the analysis, which is the logic I followed here.^[Of course, a full list of DF variables collected during the project could still go in the SM. But there are some variables that we cannot make good use of for the current analysis and they would maybe distract.] This reduction of DF variables from the full set to a reduced set could become a methodological side-story of the manuscript: The full DF is a very mixed bag and not per se a suitable tool for impact assessments or analyzing pathways of change -- but it a quite massively filled bag from which one can draw subsets for more targeted research questions.

```{r dfsum}
dfsum <- gat_tab1 %>% 
  mutate(bin = ifelse(bin==TRUE, "*", " "),
         tier1 = droplevels(tier1)) 

dfsum %>% 
  select(-tier1) %>% 
  kable(
    booktabs = TRUE,
     linesep = "",
    caption = "DF variables used in the analysis and their response distributions in the 12 villages. The asterik indicates whether a variable has originally been coded as binary and was therefore transformed to only have response options 1 and 3 (i.e., no middle option).",
    col.names = c("Third-tier variable", "1", "2", "3", " ", "Explanation of highest score"),
    ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 5.5, latex_options = "HOLD_position") %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Score\nfrequency" = 3, " " = 2)) %>% 
  kableExtra::group_rows(index = table(dfsum$tier1))
```


Then, there is the second type of data we use in the current analysis, which is *everything measured on a continuous scale* (and used as outcome or predictor). These data cannot be easily pooled with the data from Table \ref{tab:dfsum}, because they live on a different scale. The different ways to bring them on comparable scales for presentations (see previous reports) are not really ideal. Some of these other variables might correspondent to a DF dimension, but we separate them conceptually from the variables in Table \ref{tab:dfsum} due to the way they are measured and due to the role they play in the analysis. They are summarized in Table \ref{tab:othersum}.^[For economic inequality, we estimate the within-village SD from the first PC of a PCA on household assets based on the household survey [following @sharma_escalation_2023]. These assets include the availability/quality of wall, floor, roof, toilet, mobile phone, motorcycle and bed. As quick check of validity, the resuling score strongly correlates with the proportion of people in a village having a motorcycle ($r \approx 0.7$), which in this local context could be a simple indicator of wealth inequality.]

```{r othersum}
gat_tab2 %>% 
  kable(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    digits = 2,
     linesep = "",
    caption = "Other, continuously measured variables used in the analysis and their response distributions in the 12 villages.",
    col.names = c("Variable", "Mean", "Min", "Max", "Source"),
    ) %>% 
  kable_styling(font_size = 8, latex_options = "HOLD_position")%>% 
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Distribution" = 3, " " = 1)) 
```


A natural way to visualize  for all villages the data in Table \ref{tab:dfsum} is via spider plots (Figure \ref{fig:radar}), for Table \ref{tab:othersum} it is via stripe / box plots (Figure \ref{fig:boxes}).

# Item response modeling: Relation between self-reported governance processes and outcomes

This section is more or less completely drafted and open to discussion.

## Motivation

We now model the association between governance processes and governance outcomes as reported by communities. This is based on the data presented in Table \ref{tab:dfsum}. The workhorse of the analysis will be a Bayesian Item Response Model fit with `brms` [@burkner_bayesian_2020]. 

Item Response Theory (IRT) is a statistical modeling paradigm from psychology that aims to simultaneously assess the impact of subject-level and item-level influences on test scores [@linden_handbook_1997]. It can be viewed as a form of statistical adjustment for item characteristics that allows inference about unobserved latent characteristics of subjects. In our research context, the "subjects" are communities and the items are coded responses from in-depth focus group discussions and interviews. Therefore, in the context of this analysis, we also refer to the third-tier DF variables in Table \ref{tab:dfsum} as items. 

Based on the nature of our items, we propose two underlying latent traits of communities: The quality of the governance process and the quality of the governance outcome. We briefly call the two dimensions *Governance* and *Outcome*. The former is measured by the type of items that refer to governance processes -- all third-tier variables in Table \ref{tab:dfsum} listed under the first-tier categories *Resource Systems (RS)*, *Governance Systems (GS)*, *Actors (A)* and *Interactions (I)*. The latter is measured by the type of items that measure governance outcomes -- listed in Table \ref{tab:dfsum} under the first-tier category *Outcomes (O)*.^[Even though the DF does not put all of these variables into the *Governance Systems (GS)* category, they arguably reflect commons governance processes.] This distinction between these two item types is made a priori on conceptual grounds and in line with the goal to assess the association between governance processes and governance outcomes.

Variation in item responses between villages is assumed to partially reflect true variation in the underlying latent traits of villages. At the same time, the IRT models will allow to model variation in responses between items in terms of item *easiness* (characteristics of an item to produce higher responses) and item *discrimination* (characteristics of an item to produces more variable responses). Such variation is clearly suggested already by the raw data (see Table \ref{tab:dfsum}). Thus, IRT can provide a comprehensive picture of different sources of variation in item responses. Most importantly for our purpose, the model will allow to estimate the positioning of all villages on the two latent dimensions *Governance* and *Outcome*, as well as the correlation across dimensions.

Fitting the IRT model in a Bayesian framework provides a natural way to induce regularization via prior distributions and to quantify and present uncertainty. Due to the rather small sample of villages and the inherent tendency of IRT models to have a high number of parameters to be estimated from data, these aspects are both important in the present analysis. Bayesian IRT models have been gaining popularity in social-ecological research for analyzing imperfectly measured traits of natural resource users [e.g., @pretelli_rates_2022]. 

## Formal model definition

Response of village $j = 1,...,J$ on item $i = 1, ..., I$ shall be denoted as $Y_{i,j}$. Since these scores can take discrete values $k = 1,2,3$, we assume a multinomial distribution of item responses 

$$Y_{i,j} \sim \text{Multinomial}(\pi_{1, i, j}, \pi_{2, i, j}, \pi_{3, i, j})$$

where $\pi_{k, i, j}$ denotes the probability of village $j$ to choose response $k$ on item $i$. Note that $\pi_{1, i, j} + \pi_{2, i, j}+ \pi_{3, i, j} = 1$ for all $i,j$.

Given the ordinal nature of the items responses, we use the cumulative logit link with common slopes.^[In the IRT terminology, such models are known as "Graded Response Models" [@linden_handbook_1997].] Accordingly, the probability to give response $k$ or less can can be written as a function of a category-specific threshold parameter $\beta_k$ and a linear combination of village- and item-level characteristics $\eta_{i,j}$, which will ultimately be of substantive interest to us. Higher values of $\eta_{i,j}$ mean a higher expected response category. Further, an item-specific discrimination parameter $a_i$ controls the magnitude of the effect that any predictors have on the response distribution for that item. This leads to

$$
P(Y_{i,j} \leq k) = \text{logit}^{-1} \left((\alpha + a_i) ( \beta_k - \eta_{i,j} ) \right), 
$$

where $\alpha$ is an intercept parameter for item discrimination, such that $a_i$ represent deviations from mean discrimination for each item. Via including $a_i$, we acknowledge that items do not have constant discrimination. In IRT terminology, this leads to the so-called "two-parameter model" [@linden_handbook_1997], since an additional item-level parameter besides item easiness (or, difficulty, see below) is introduced.^[The discrimination parameter can be understood as an effect modifier, or as an item-specific variance parameter, see @burkner_ordinal_2019. Due to the multiplicativeness of this relationship, the two-parameter model is no more linear in the parameters.]

The probabilities to give responses $k = 1,2,3$ can hence be written as

\begin{align*}
\pi_{1, i, j} & = P(Y_{i,j} = 1) = \text{logit}^{-1}\left((\alpha + a_i) ( \beta_1 - \eta_{i,j} ) \right), \\
\pi_{2, i, j} & = P(Y_{i,j} = 2) = \text{logit}^{-1}\left((\alpha + a_i) ( \beta_2 - \eta_{i,j} ) \right) - \pi_{1, i, j}, \\
\pi_{3, i, j} & = P(Y_{i,j} = 3) = 1 - \pi_{2, i, j} - \pi_{1, i, j},
\end{align*}

Most importantly, $\eta_{i,j}$ shall be affected by $\theta_j^{\text{Gov}}$ and $\theta_j^{\text{Out}}$. These parameters describe the quality of governance processes and of outcomes in village $j$, respectively. Note that here we are ultimately interested in their correlation parameter $\rho_{\text{Gov},\text{Out}}$. In line with the IRT framework, we will model $\eta_{i,j}$ also as a function of easiness of the item, $b_i$. Accordingly, we write


$$\eta_{i,j} = b_i + \theta_j^{\text{Gov}} \text{Gov}_i + \theta_j^{\text{Out}} \text{Out}_i ,$$
where $\text{Gov}_i$ is an indicator that is 1 if item $i$ is of type *Governance* and 0 otherwise. $\text{Out}_i$ is an indicator that is 1 if item $i$ is of type *Outcome* and 0 otherwise.

Finally, working in a Bayesian framework with varying parameters, we assume that item- and village-level parameters follow the distributions

\begin{align*}
a_i & \sim N(0, \sigma^2_a), \\
b_i & \sim N(0, \sigma^2_b), \\
(\theta_j^{\text{Gov}}, \theta_j^{\text{Out}}) & \sim N(\bm{0}, D), \text{with} \\ 
& D =
\begin{pmatrix}
\sigma^2_{\text{Gov}} & \sigma_{\text{Gov},\text{Out}}\\
\sigma_{\text{Gov},\text{Out}} & \sigma^2_{\text{Out}}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}

This implies that the two item parameters $a_i$ and $b_i$ are assumed independent.^[This is a common assumption in IRT models and it is helpful in a sparse-data context like ours.] The two village-parameters $\theta_j^{\text{Gov}}$ and $\theta_j^{\text{Out}}$, however, follow a bivariate normal distribution with covariance $\sigma_{\text{Gov},\text{Out}}$. We can hence define our parameter of interest, the correlation between governance and outcome quality, based on the IRT model as 

$$\rho_{\text{Gov},\text{Out}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{Gov},\text{Out}}}{\sigma_{\text{Gov}} \sigma_{\text{Out}}}.$$


By choosing adaptive priors that induce partial pooling, above IRT model becomes a Bayesian multilevel model [@burkner_bayesian_2020]. Specifically, we work with the following priors:

\textcolor{red}{to write down:}

- denn $\sigma_{b}$ bekommt nichts fixes, sondern selbst estimated und hyperprior

- Note constancy restritions that need to be done. (identifiability! see also Bayesian IRT book)

- Weakly informative Bayesian priors are used which shrink item and village effects towards zero. This ensures model convergence and stability of estimates, thereby also being generally conservative.

- Not adjusted with other covariates.

- Note that the approach allows us to even keep items with no variability in the sample.

- In results dann $a_i$ zeigen: das was aus dem Modell kommt also umdrehen, so dass hohere werte = mehr discrimination. AuÃerdem: By default, disc is modeled on the log-scale to ensure that the actual discrimination estimates are positive (see Section 5.1 for a discussion of that issue). 

Ordinal-Paper sagt: 

As discussed in Section 2.4.2, by default we assume
411 the variance of the latent variable to be the same throughout the model, an assumption
412 unavoidable in linear regression.4 Within the framework of ordinal models in brms, we can
413 relax this assumption. For the stem cell data, this implies asking whether variances of the
414 stem cell funding opinion differ across categories of religious belief. Conceptually, unequal variances are incorporated in the model by specifying an
additional regression formula for the variance component of the latent variable YË . In brms,
the parameter related to latent variances is called disc (short for âdiscriminationâ), following
conventions in item response theory. Importantly, disc is not the variance itself, but the
inverse of the standard deviation, s. That is, s = 1/disc. Further, because disc must be
strictly positive, it is by default modeled on the log-scale.

back-transfotmation goes like this:

The estimated parameters of the unequal variance model are summarized in Table
439 4. As discussed above, disc is the inverse of the standard deviation of YË , and by default
440 modeled through a log-link, that is we predict log(disc) instead of disc. To also display
441 the standard deviations s, we transformed log(disc) to s with s = 1/ exp(log(disc)).5

## Results



# Modeling remote sensing outcomes as a result of governance processes

- make sure that these are (mostly) mututally exclusive, which is an assumption I used and monique shares: "I assume maize wheat and bean fields dont look bare in a satelite image". We asked Nathaniel. Maybe we need to look into the polygon files

- add to dag an edge from rainfall to governance: "I guess pastoralist (PA) institutions breakdown where rainfall makes agriculture and option, and possibly where rainfall makes outsiders beg for grazing."

- maybe extend dag: "The DAG starting page 20 on bare ground looks pretty good to me, but I think weâd need a zoom session with Majory and Susan where you explain it, as they are more likely to think of additional paths/variables than I am."

# Modeling wealth outcomes as a result of governance processes

- wealth inequality from PCA, for example @sharma_escalation_2023.

- "but I did think (again initially) it would be nice to have a measure of wealth (averaged across households) and inequality in wealth. I could think about this more if I wer to turn back to the original data, but now. But having wealth and inequality in wealth as an outcomes measure woud be kind of cool. I know its weak, as it is also something of a predictor variable f success (presumably), and without a longitudinal perspective inference is weak, but even with those prosvisos it might be worth including in the current modelling structure as a village level âoutcomeâ."

# Governance processes and outcomes under disturbances

- "it would be good to look at interactins and/or mediations with disturbances, and I agree rainfall, ethnic/econ heterogeneity, and pop growth are all good candidates, if handled separately"

- "external threats could be added to the disturbance analysis discussed earlier â worth doing, even if only ends up in SM so we can say in the the MS that we examined disturbances."

- rainfall variability can also be used: "Pastoralist scholars are oftn mre concerned about rainfall unpredictabiilty and variability than mean amount, but under the current circumstances of increasing drought, this measure may be fine for us. I will keep my eyes open for how rainfall is being used in recent paper"

- there is a hypothesis why rainfall might cause worse pastoralist governacne processes and outcomes: "I guess pastoralist (PA) institutions breakdown where rainfall makes agriculture and option, and possibly where rainfall makes outsiders beg for grazing." and it could lead to discussion like: "'Is agriculture a feasible livelihood option?'. It might lead on from the finding (prelim pr page 12 descriptive analysis) that rainfall has neg effects on governance, on the logic that if PA institutions suffer in wetter areas, what is the logic for mving to agric. [Very politically un PC, but possibly worth investigating for the area]."

# Comparing remote sensing outcomes with a control group

- "might require some sort of âsynthetic counterfactualâ. Quite how we deal with the fact that NTRI presumably selected the villages for intervention on the basis of some criteria will take some thought. Initially Susan or Majory could help us here. I am not sure that our 12 villages comprise the full set of NTRI targets â this would help us enormously with developing controls for GIS."
