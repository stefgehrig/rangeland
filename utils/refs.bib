	abstract = {Population declines in shark species have been reported on local and global scales, with overfishing, habitat destruction and climate change posing severe threats. The lack of species-specific baseline data on ecology and distribution of many sharks, however, makes conservation measures challenging. Here, we present a fisheries-independent shark survey from the Fiji Islands, where scientific knowledge on locally occurring elasmobranchs is largely still lacking despite the location's role as a shark hotspot in the Pacific. Juvenile shark abundance in the fishing grounds of the Ba Estuary (north-western Viti Levu) was assessed with a gillnet- and longline-based survey from December 2015 to April 2016. A total of 103 juvenile sharks identified as blacktip Carcharhinus limbatus (n = 57), scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini (n = 35), and great hammerhead Sphyrna mokarran (n = 11) sharks were captured, tagged, and released. The condition of umbilical scars (68\% open or semihealed), mean sizes of individuals (±SD) (C. limbatus: 66.5 ± 3.8 cm, S. lewini: 51.8 ± 4.8 cm, S. mokarran 77.4 ± 2.8 cm), and the presence of these species over recent years (based on fishermen interviews), suggest that the Ba Estuary area is a critical habitat for multiple species that are classified as “Near Threatened” or “Endangered.” Specifically, the area likely acts as a parturition ground over the studied period, and potentially as a subsequent nursery area. We identified subareas of high abundance and found that temperature, salinity and depth acted as small-scale environmental drivers of shark abundance. The data suggests a tendency for species-specific spatial use, both horizontally (i.e., between sampling areas) and vertically (i.e., across the water column). These results enhance the understanding of shark ecology in Fiji and provide a scientific basis for the implementation of local conservation strategies that contribute to the protection of these threatened species.},

	abstract = {, 
Microfinance is an economic development tool that provides loans to low-income borrowers to stimulate economic growth and reduce financial hardship. Lenders typically require joint liability, where multiple borrowers share the responsibility of repaying a group loan. We propose that this lending practice creates a cooperation dilemma similar to that faced by humans and other organisms in nature across many domains. This could offer a real-world test case for evolutionary theories of cooperation from the biological sciences. In turn, such theories could provide new insights into loan repayment behaviour. We first hypothesise how group loan repayment efficacy should be affected by mechanisms of assortment from the evolutionary literature on cooperation, i.e. common ancestry (kin selection), prior interaction (reciprocity), partner choice, similarity of tags, social learning, and ecology and demography. We then assess selected hypotheses by reviewing 41 studies from 32 countries on micro-borrowers’ loan repayment, evaluating which characteristics of borrowers are associated with credit repayment behaviour. Surprisingly, we find that kinship is mostly negatively associated with repayment efficacy, but prior interaction and partner choice are both more positively associated. Our work highlights the scope of evolutionary theory to provide systematic insight into how humans respond to novel economic institutions and interventions.},

	abstract = {Resource users’ perceptions are crucial for successful marine governance because they affect community support, participation and legitimacy. Efforts have been made to understand how fishers’ attitudes, understandings and interpretations of the environment and its governance emerge in small-scale fisheries. However, many quantitative studies have focused on how individual-level attributes like socio-demographics are associated with perceptions, ignoring a fundamental scale at which humans arrive at their views about the world – the social group. In multi-gear fisheries, fishers typically cluster in two overlapping types of group: occupational groups (defined by fishing gear) and village communities. Taking into account also individual-level variables, which group type is more associated with particular environmental and governance perceptions, e.g. about change in fish stocks, collective action or appropriate management actions? Through questionnaires in combination with multivariate and multi-model inference, this study reveals that, among fishers in two villages in Zanzibar (n = 172), village is more associated with perceptions than occupational group or any other factor. Further, individual attributes like education and age influence perceptions. The main finding implies that the role of social-cultural processes might have been underestimated in quantitative research on research users’ perceptions. This has consequences for policy and research and shows that both can be informed by statistical analyses that disentangles effects of different levels of group belonging.},

	abstract = {Mate choice that is based on behavioural traits is a common feature in the animal kingdom. Using the Trinidadian guppy, a species with mutual mate choice, we investigated whether males use female swimming activity—a behavioural trait known to differ consistently among individuals in many species—as a trait relevant for their mate choice. In the first experiment, we assessed male and female activity in an open field test alone (two repeated measures) and afterwards in heterosexual pairs (two repeated measures). In these pairs, we simultaneously assessed males’ mating efforts by counting the number of sexual behaviours (courtship displays and copulations). Male and female guppies showed consistent individual differences in their swimming activity when tested both alone and in a pair, and these differences were maintained across both test situations. When controlling for male swimming behaviour and both male and female body size, males performed more courtship displays towards females with higher swimming activity. In a second experiment, we tested for a directional male preference for swimming activity by presenting males video animations of low- and high-active females in a dichotomous choice test. In congruence with experiment 1, we found males to spend significantly more time in association with the high-active female stimulus. Both experiments thus point towards a directional male preference for higher activity levels in females. We discuss the adaptive significance of this preference as activity patterns might indicate individual female quality, health or reproductive state while, mechanistically, females that are more active might be more detectable to males as well.},

Incentive-based policy instruments are key tools for meeting these goals, yet their effectiveness might be undermined by such factors as social norms regarding whether payments are considered fair. We investigated the causal link between equity and conservation effort with a randomized real-effort experiment in forest conservation with 443 land users near a tropical forest national park in the Vietnamese Central Annamites, a global biodiversity hotspot. The experiment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribution. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by inequality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive-based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substantially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing payment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change.},

Yet, often user groups are socioculturally heterogeneous, which requires cooperation to be established across salient group boundaries. We explore the effect of this type of heterogeneity on resource extraction in lab-in-the-field Common Pool Resource (CPR) experiments in Zanzibar, Tanzania. We create heterogeneous groups by mixing fishers from two neighbouring fishing villages which have distinct social identities, a history of conflict and diverging resource use practices and institutions. Additionally, we analyse between-village differences in extraction behaviour in the heterogeneous setting to assess if out-group cooperation in a CPR dilemma is associated with a community’s institutional scope in the economic realm (e.g., degree of market integration). We find no aggregate effect of heterogeneity on extraction. However, this is because fishers from the two villages behave differently in the heterogeneity treatment. We find support for the hypothesis that cooperation under sociocultural heterogeneity is higher for fishers from the village with larger institutional scope. In line with this explanation, cooperation under heterogeneity also correlates with a survey measure of individual fishers’ radius of trust. We discuss implications for resource governance and collective action research.},

	abstract = {Aims The TIM-HF2 study showed less days lost due to unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization or all-cause death and improved survival in patients randomly assigned to remote patient management (RPM) instead of standard of care. Methods and results This substudy explored whether the biomarkers mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) could be used to identify low-risk patients unlikely to benefit from RPM, thereby allowing more efficient allocation of the intervention. For 1538 patients of the trial (median age 73 years, interquartile range 64–78 years, 30\% female), baseline biomarkers were used to select subpopulations recommended for RPM with various safety endpoints (100\%, 98\%, 95\% sensitivity), and efficacy of RPM was assessed. Both biomarkers were strongly associated with events. The primary endpoint of lost days increased from 1.0\% (1.4\%) in the lowest to 17.3\% (17.6\%) in the highest quintile of NT-proBNP (MR-proADM). After combining biomarkers to identify patients recommended for RPM with 95\% sensitivity, in the most efficient scenario (excluding 27\% of patients; NT-proBNP {\textless} 413.7 pg/mL and MR-proADM {\textless} 0.75 nmol/L), the effect of RPM on patients was highly similar to the original trial (ratio of lost days: 0.78, hazard ratio for all-cause death: 0.68). Number needed to treat for all-cause death was lowered from 28 to 21. Rates of emergencies and telemedical efforts were significantly lower among patients not recommended for RPM. Biomarker guidance would have saved about 150 h effort/year per 100 patients of the eligible population. Conclusions The combined use of MR-proADM and NT-proBNP may allow safe, more precise, effective and cost-saving allocation of patients with heart failure to RPM and warrants further prospective studies.},

	abstract = {Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) are widespread in conservation policy. In PES, environmental effectiveness and social equity are often perceived as conflicting goals. Empirical studies on the relationship between popular design features, such as payment differentiation and payment conditionality, and effectiveness and equity are scarce. Further, they struggle with measuring and separating ecological and equity outcomes. In this study, we combine two incentivized lab-in-the-field experiments with 259 land users from eight villages in North-Western Vietnam to assess both individual conservation effort and community-level equity perceptions under four different PES designs. Effort is measured in a real-effort task with real-world environmental benefits; equity perceptions about payment designs in the real-effort task are measured in a coordination game. We demonstrate that payment design affects both effort and equity perceptions. Payments which are differentiated and are solely conditional on individuals’ contributions of effort are perceived as most equitable. They are also more effective in motivating conservation effort than other designs, although the differences are small and not significant for all comparisons. By working out the positive correlation of effectiveness and equity across the four payment schemes, we show that these objectives are not necessarily conflicting goals in incentive-based conservation policy. Further, we can show that women exert greater conservation efforts. We discuss how greater equity and effectiveness could be achieved with reforms towards more input-based distribution criteria in Vietnam’s PES legislation and the limitations and opportunities of the experimental paradigm for research on PES.},

	doi = {10.1097/01.CCM.0000254722.50608.2D},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore registered nurses' and attending physicians' perspectives on caring for dying patients in intensive care units (ICUs), with particular attention to the relationships among moral distress, ethical climate, physician/nurse collaboration, and satisfaction with quality of care.
DESIGN: Descriptive pilot study using a survey design.
SETTING: Fourteen ICUs in two institutions in different regions of Virginia.
SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine attending physicians who admitted patients to the ICUs and 196 registered nurses engaged in direct patient care.
INTERVENTIONS: Survey questionnaire.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the first site, registered nurses reported lower collaboration (p{\textless}.001), higher moral distress (p{\textless}.001), a more negative ethical environment (p{\textless}.001), and less satisfaction with quality of care (p=.005) than did attending physicians. The highest moral distress situations for both registered nurses and physicians involved those situations in which caregivers felt pressured to continue unwarranted aggressive treatment. Nurses perceived distressing situations occurring more frequently than did physicians. At the second site, 45\% of the registered nurses surveyed reported having left or considered leaving a position because of moral distress. For physicians, collaboration related to satisfaction with quality of care (p{\textless}.001) and ethical environment (p=.004); for nurses, collaboration was related to satisfaction (p{\textless}.001) and ethical climate (p{\textless}.001) at both sites and negatively related to moral distress at site 2 (p=.05). Overall, registered nurses with higher moral distress scores had lower satisfaction with quality of care (p{\textless}.001), lower perception of ethical environment (p{\textless}.001), and lower perception of collaboration (p{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Registered nurses experienced more moral distress and lower collaboration than physicians, they perceived their ethical environment as more negative, and they were less satisfied with the quality of care provided on their units than were physicians. Provider assessments of quality of care were strongly related to perception of collaboration. Improving the ethical climate in ICUs through explicit discussions of moral distress, recognition of differences in nurse/physician values, and improving collaboration may mitigate frustration arising from differences in perspective.},

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to mitigate the harmful effects of moral distress experienced by nursing and medical clinicians working in the intensive care setting.
Design
Eligible studies were identified from searches of PubMed, EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL and Medline) and Scopus. Included studies were published prior to 20 August 2020.
Results
Twelve studies were included in this review comprising three randomised controlled trials, seven quasi-randomised trials and two observational studies. Nine studies reported interventions targeting only nurses while three included both nurses and doctors. The types of interventions identified included: moral empowerment programs, end-of-life educational programs, reflective exercises through individual narrative writing or group reflective debriefing, multidisciplinary case debriefing meetings integrated into clinical practice and moral resiliency training. Due to the overall low methodological quality and high risk of bias, no single intervention may be considered efficacious in managing moral distress.
Conclusions
There is weak evidence that some currently available interventions reduce the moral distress experienced by intensive care health care providers. Larger randomised trials involving all intensive healthcare clinicians are required to evaluate multifaceted interventions.},

This type of scheme, especially in the guise of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, has received increasing attention. We set up and analyze the ‘repayment game’ which group lending gives rise to. Our analysis suggests that such schemes have both positive and negative effects on repayment rates. The positive effect is that successful group members may have an incentive to repay the loans of group members whose projects have yielded insufficient return to make repayment worthwhile. The negative effect arises when the whole group defaults, even when some members would have repaid under individual lending. We also show how group lending may harness social collateral, which serves to mitigate its negative effect.},

They do so by providing loans to groups of individuals who are jointly liable for their repayment. This model of lending creates a cooperative dilemma because if any member of a loan group defects and does not repay his/her share of the loan, the other members of the group are liable to repay it for him/her. Maintaining cooperation among borrowers and solving the cooperative dilemma created by the microfinance model may be crucial to ensure loan repayment. A vast literature in economics identifies factors that encourage successful loan repayment in microfinance initiatives and those that prevent defaults. Here, I compare the economic literature on microfinance and the equally prolific evolutionary literature on factors that encourage and maintain cooperation among individuals. I identify parallels between these two bodies of research, which have so far developed independently. Bringing them together enables us to examine the power and limitations of applying evolutionary theory to contemporary economic issues and may stimulate novel questions and insights in both disciplines.},

We are motivated by an apparent shift away from the use of joint liability by microfinance institutions, combined with recent evidence that a) converting joint liability groups to individual liability groups did not affect repayment rates, and b) an intervention that increased social capital in individual liability borrowing groups led to improved repayment performance. First, we show that individual lending with or without groups may constitute a welfare improvement over joint liability, so long as borrowers have sufficient social capital to sustain mutual insurance. Second, we explore how the lender's lower transaction costs in group lending can encourage insurance by reducing the amount borrowers have to pay to bail one another out. Third, we discuss how group meetings might encourage insurance, either by increasing the incentive to invest in social capital, or because the time spent in meetings can facilitate setting up insurance arrangements. Finally, we perform a simple simulation exercise, evaluating quantitatively the welfare impacts of alternative forms of lending and how they relate to social capital.},

	abstract = {We investigate how external social ties, that is, social ties with individuals outside the borrowing group, determine loan repayments of individual borrowers in joint liability group lending. We measure the resources in external ties in terms of the informal risk insurance arrangement they embed. The ties borrowers have with individuals outside the group and the informal risk insurance arrangement they represent, help to survive in general, and repay their loans in particular. The risk of losing these ties increases the willingness to repay loans, that is, these ties can be regarded as a form of collateral to stimulate loan repayment. The extent to which these external ties are effectively pledged as collateral depends on the extent to which social networks of group members are overlapping: the more borrowers’ networks of external ties overlap (referred to as information channels), the higher the risk of losing the informal risk insurance arrangement in case of non-repayment. We use data from 802 mapped social networks of borrowers’ internal and external ties from a microfinance institution in Mexico. We find that group borrowers with external ties, representing a strong informal risk insurance arrangement while at the same time being information channels, have lower repayment problems},

	abstract = {The theoretical literature sees cost-effective peer monitoring as a key to the success of joint-liability over individual-liability credit. Yet peer monitoring may also involve particular costs, such as the cost of denouncing wrongdoing, that are larger for group members than for the lender. Moreover, in practice, joint-liability credit often involves monitoring by the lender. To investigate the role of external monitoring and explore the nature of the costs associated with internal group monitoring, we conduct a field experiment in joint-liability credit groups in Burkina Faso. In the experiment, we randomly increase the intensity of external monitoring in credit groups. We find that external monitoring crowds out monitoring by the group leader, causes loan renewal decisions to be more severe and the handling of individual default to be more state-dependent. In addition, increased external monitoring decreases favoritism towards members of the leader’s family. We argue that external monitoring reduces the costs of “pointing fingers” at moral-hazardous behaviors and of sanctioning.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates performance drivers of microfinance suppliers in Europe. As such suppliers, in contrast to advanced microfinance suppliers in developing economies, typically focus on uncollateralized microcredit services to individuals at the margins of society and of labor markets, we draw on the theory of social capital and empirically investigate the role that social capital may play in the overall performance of European microfinance suppliers. We build a unique, unbalanced panel data set of 302 microfinance service providers in Europe covering the years 2008–2015, and measure their performance in terms of credit risk, financial and social performance, and efficiency. Pursuing an econometric approach, we test a series of hypotheses using various measures of conditions conducive to building social capital on both the institutional and the country level, such as the client base of a microfinance supplier and the level of cultural fractionalization in a society. Our findings confirm that a higher intensity of social capital is positively associated with all areas of the performance of microfinance suppliers in Europe. Our conclusions could help in the design and launch of microfinance institutions in those European countries in which microfinance markets are developed not at all or only to a very limited extent. Our paper thus contributes to the nascent literature on microfinance in developed economies by applying and extending the theoretical framework and empirical models on social capital and microfinance that were originally elaborated for developing economies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the microfinance industry has received a substantial amount of cross-border funding from both public and private sources. This funding reflects the increasing interest in microfinance as part of a more general trend towards socially responsible investments. In order to be able to secure sustained interest from these investors, it is important that the microfinance industry can show evidence of its contribution to reducing poverty at the bottom of the pyramid. For this, it is crucial to understand under what conditions microfinance institutions (MFIs) are able to reduce poverty. This paper contributes to this discussion by investigating the relationship between the extent to which social capital formation is facilitated within different societies and the financial and social performance of MFIs. This focus on social capital formation is important, because in many cases MFIs use group loans with joint liability to incentivize asset-poor borrowers to substitute the lack of physical collateral by their social capital. Hence, the success of a large part of the loan relationship between MFIs and their borrowers depends on the social capital those borrowers can bring into the contract. We carry out a cross-country analysis on a dataset containing 100 countries and identify different social dimensions as proxies for how easy social capital can be developed in different countries. We hypothesize that microfinance is more successful, both in terms of their financial and social aims, in societies that are more conducive to the development of social capital. Our empirical results support our hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Galton’s Problem is one of identifying functional relationships in a set of observations where the observations may be related through borrowing or descent. The problem has long been recognized in the fields of anthropology and cross-cultural research, but has been neglected in economics, even in cases where it is likely to be most acute, such as in regression models where each observation is a nation. The appropriate treatment for Galton’s Problem was developed in the 1980s by Malcolm M. Dow, Douglas R. White, and Michael L. Burton. Their solution is to estimate spatial models, where weight matrices for physical distance control for relationships of borrowing, and weight matrices for linguistic similarity control for relationships of descent. This paper documents a method for estimating a weight matrix based on language phylogenetic relationships. The method is applied to the 186 cultures of the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, and applied to a set of 216 nations. The resulting weight matrices are made available for any researchers wishing to control for Galton’s Problem.},

Languages fit a tree model of evolution well, at least in their basic vocabulary, challenging the view that blending, or admixture among neighbouring groups, was predominant in cultural history. Here, we argue that we can use language trees to test hypotheses about not only cultural history and diversification, but also bio-cultural adaptation. Phylogenetic comparative methods take account of the non-independence of cultures (Galton's problem), which can cause spurious statistical associations in comparative analyses. Advances in phylogenetic methods offer new possibilities for the analysis of cultural evolution, including estimating the rate of evolution and the direction of coevolutionary change of traits on the tree. They also enable phylogenetic uncertainty to be incorporated into the analyses, so that one does not have to treat phylogenetic trees as if they were known without error.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many social scientists have claimed that trust plays an important role in economic and social transactions. Despite its proposed importance, the measurement and the definition of trust seem to be not fully settled, and the identification of the exact role of trust in economic interactions has proven to be elusive. It is still not clear whether trust is just an epiphenomenon of good institutions or whether it plays an independent causal role capable of shaping important aggregate economic outcomes. In this paper, I rely on a behavioral definition of trust that enables us to relate it to economic primitives such as preferences and beliefs. I review strong biological and behavioral evidence indicating that trusting is not just a special case of risk-taking, but based on important forms of social preferences such as betrayal aversion. Behaviorally defined trust also opens the door for understanding national and ethnic trust differences in terms of differences in preferences and beliefs, and it suggests ways to examine and interpret a causal role of trust.

Based on 66 short interviews conducted in seven rural provinces of Burundi, our exploratory study analyzes the entrepreneurial potential in four instances of rule-evasion: consumption spending, illegitimate investment, loan juggling and loan arrogation. We argue that some of the unruly practices are in fact entrepreneurial, as they create tangible and intangible value for the rural poor at both household and community levels. These include strengthening social ties through gift exchange and ceremonies, which then help poor households to self-insure against shocks through social networks. By analyzing the push and pull factors for unruly behavior, we show that rule-breaking practices are often necessitated by the microfinance industry itself and call for increased flexibility and adaptability of microfinance products.},

Despite this, defectors often go unpunished and groups with social structures that are a priori favorable often fail. A critical distinction is required between the structural effect on ability versus willingness to punish. We develop a theoretical framework in which variation in a group’s social structure generates a tension between ability and willingness to enforce cooperation. Structures that promote ability to punish also often reduce interest in carrying out sanctions, thus changing collective outcomes. Our empirical analysis involves a well-defined cooperative dilemma: group lending in Sierra Leone. We complement statistical modelling, based on a dataset containing 5,487 group repayments, with ethnographic analysis. We find: (1) Structural cohesion only increases economic cooperation between borrowers to a point, beyond which unwillingness outweighs increased ability to punish, reducing group repayments. (2) Groups with disconnected subgroups perform worse on average. Although borrowers are more willing to punish defectors in the out-subgroup, they are unable to do so effectively.},

The theory of ‘morality as cooperation’ uses the mathematics of cooperation—the theory of nonzero-sum games—to identify the many distinct problems of cooperation and their solutions, and it predicts that it is the solutions employed by humans that constitute ‘morality’. Thus, morality turns out to be a collection of biological and cultural solutions to the problems of cooperation and conflict recurrent in human social life. This theory generates a comprehensive taxonomy of moral values—a Periodic Table of Ethics—that includes obligations to family, group loyalty, reciprocity, bravery, respect, fairness, and property rights. And because morality as cooperation makes principled predictions about the structure and content of human morality, which can be tested against those of rival theories, it reveals that the study of morality is simply another branch of science.},

Here, we examine individuals' and communities' models of what it means to be good and bad and how they correspond to corollary behavior across a variety of socioecological contexts. Our sample includes over 600 people from eight different field sites that include foragers, horticulturalists, herders, and the fully market-reliant. We first examine the universals and particulars of explicit moral models. We then use these moral models to assess their role in the outcome of an economic experiment designed to detect systematic, dishonest rule-breaking favoritism. We show that individuals are slightly more inclined to play by the rules when their moral models include the task-relevant virtues of “honesty” and “dishonesty.” We also find that religious beliefs are better predictors of honest play than these virtues. The predictive power of these values' and beliefs' local prevalence, however, remains inconclusive. In summary, we find that religious beliefs and moral models may help promote honest behavior that may widen the breadth of human cooperation.},

In societies where the power of the family is very high, the quality of public institutions tends to be low. This connection shapes the behavior of taxpayers and tends to increase the underground economy. The econometric analysis is based on linear panel data models and a new original dataset that puts together data on personal values, social capital and tax morale, in combination with an index of the shadow economy. The final results show that in countries where family ties are stronger, the level of trust and tax morale is lower, while underground economy is higher.},

	abstract = {While joint liability group lending has been shown to resolve information problems in rural credit markets, the mutual insurance against default provided by such contracts is subject to moral hazard, resulting in the well-known free-riding problem. As with standard insurance, one solution to this problem is the imposition of a deductible, which under a joint liability contract amounts to an individual collateral requirement. Conceptually, such a hybrid contract should reduce morally hazardous behavior but have an ambiguous impact on credit market participation, as the collateral requirement would simultaneously crowd in and ration out different types of borrowers. In order to empirically test these effects, we employ a framed field experiment with credit group members in Tanzania. Our results show that the imposition of a modest (20\%) individual collateral requirement in a joint liability group significantly increases effort supplied to the loan-financed project by 5\% while reducing credit market participation by 7 percentage points. This amounts to an overall reduction in loan defaults of approximately 20\%. Although we conceptually would expect the effect of the individual collateral requirement to vary by risk aversion and social connectedness, we find no such heterogeneous impacts in the data.},

	abstract = {Incentive-based measures are increasingly popular to alleviate ongoing biodiversity loss and greenhouse gas emissions from land use change. However, effectively using scarce conservation funds remains a major challenge. Using behavioral economic experiments in the buffer zone of a Vietnamese national park, we show that unfair payment distributions that are beyond land users’ control can reduce the environmental effectiveness of incentives, and that women exert more effort. Our study region is threatened by forest degradation and is part of the nationwide Vietnamese Payments for Forest Ecosystem Services program, making it an important and relevant context for improving the effectiveness of conservation measures. These results show that policymakers aiming for effective and efficient programs should pay close attention to fairness and gender.Global efforts for biodiversity protection and land use-based greenhouse gas mitigation call for increases in the effectiveness and efficiency of environmental conservation. Incentive-based policy instruments are key tools for meeting these goals, yet their effectiveness might be undermined by such factors as social norms regarding whether payments are considered fair. We investigated the causal link between equity and conservation effort with a randomized real-effort experiment in forest conservation with 443 land users near a tropical forest national park in the Vietnamese Central Annamites, a global biodiversity hotspot. The experiment introduced unjustified payment inequality based on luck, in contradiction of local fairness norms that were measured through responses to vignettes. Payment inequality was perceived as less fair than payment equality. In agreement with our preregistered hypotheses, participants who were disadvantaged by unequal payments exerted significantly less conservation effort than other participants receiving the same payment under an equal distribution. No effect was observed for participants advantaged by inequality. Thus, equity effects on effort can have consequences for the effectiveness and efficiency of incentive-based conservation instruments. Furthermore, we show that women exerted substantially more conservation effort than men, and that increasing payment size unexpectedly reduced effort. This emphasizes the need to consider social comparisons, local equity norms, and gender in environmental policies using monetary incentives to motivate behavioral change.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies seek to identify predictors of broad-scale patterns in human cultural diversity, but three sources of non-independence in human cultural variables can bias the results of cross-cultural studies. First, related cultures tend to have many traits in common, regardless of whether those traits are functionally linked. Second, societies in geographical proximity will share many aspects of culture, environment and demography. Third, many cultural traits covary, leading to spurious relationships between traits. Here, we demonstrate tractable methods for dealing with all three sources of bias. We use cross-cultural analyses of proposed associations between human cultural traits and parasite load to illustrate the potential problems of failing to correct for these three forms of statistical non-independence. Associations between parasite stress and sociosexuality, authoritarianism, democracy and language diversity are weak or absent once relatedness and proximity are taken into account, and parasite load has no more power to explain variation in traditionalism, religiosity and collectivism than other measures of biodiversity, climate or population size do. Without correction for statistical non-independence and covariation in cross-cultural analyses, we risk misinterpreting associations between culture and environment.},

Against the backdrop of the shortcomings of previous cross-sectional analyses, this paper utilizes two Danish panel surveys containing measures of both types of trust for the same individuals surveyed at multiple points in time over a long time-span (up to 18 years) to address the potentially reverse and/or spurious relationship. Using individual fixed effects and cross-lagged panel models, the results provide strong evidence of trust in state institutions exercising a causal impact on social trust, whereas the evidence for a reverse relationship is limited.},

	abstract = {Cross-national research on cultural differences across space and time intersects multiple disciplines but the prominence of concepts varies by academic fields. Hofstede’s dimensional concept of culture, to begin with, dominates in cross-cultural psychology and international management. Inglehart’s dynamic concept of culture, by contrast, prevails in sociology and political science. We argue that this disciplinary division is unfortunate because the two concepts are complementary, for which reason a synthesis rectifies their mutual weaknesses. Indeed, while Hofstede’s dimensional concept neglects cultural dynamics, Inglehart’s dynamic concept is dimensionally reductionist. We demonstrate empirically that combining these two concepts leads to an improved understanding of cultural differences. Inspired by Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, we use data from the European Value Studies and World Values Surveys for 495,011 individuals born between 1900 and 1999 in 110 countries and then show that change on these dimensions proceeds as Inglehart and his collaborators suggest. Most notably, younger generations have become more individualistic and more joyous. But even though economic development and generational replacement drive this cultural change, roughly half of the variation in national cultural orientations is unique to each country, due to lasting intercept differences in developmental trajectories that trace back to remote historic drivers. We discuss the implications for cross-national cultural research.},

But what do we know about how MFIs reach and combine these two goals? We carry out a systematic review of close to 170 papers discussing the determinants of the financial and social performance of MFIs. The review shows that the most important determinants addressed in the literature are MFI characteristics (size, age and type of organization), their funding sources, the quality of organizational governance and the MFIs’ external context such as macro-economic, institutional and political conditions. The evidence on these issues is rather mixed. Moreover, the direction of the relationship between these drivers and MFI performance depends on the context, particularly the country-specific context. Finally, there is a lack of consensus in the literature on the measurement of financial and social performance. Due to the complexity of the concept, we argue that social performance should only be assessed by using a multidimensional perspective. This can be done either by applying recent and holistic social performance measures such as the SPI4, or at least by using a combination of proxies, such as outreach, gender and rural measures.},

In our dynamic general equilibrium model, individuals perceiving nepotistic labor markets experience a weaker economic motive to invest in human capital. Nepotism is explained as an evolving cultural norm with different nepotistic equilibria, which are relevant for economic development. We test the central prediction of the model by relating scores from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to an indicator for perceived nepotism at the country level. Our findings indicate a negative association between nepotism and human capital. Subsample analysis and fixed effects estimations further corroborate the incentive narrative.},

	abstract = {The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies in psychological and educational research aim to estimate population average treatment effects (PATE) using data from large complex survey samples, and many of these studies use propensity score methods. Recent advances have investigated how to incorporate survey weights with propensity score methods. However, to this point, that work had not been well summarized, and it was not clear how much difference the different PATE estimation methods would make empirically.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to systematically summarize the appropriate use of survey weights in propensity score analysis of complex survey data and use a case study to empirically compare the PATE estimates using multiple analysis methods that include ordinary least squares regression, weighted least squares regression, and various propensity score applications.
METHODS: We first summarize various propensity score methods that handle survey weights. We then demonstrate the performance of various analysis methods using a nationally representative data set, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten to estimate the effects of preschool on children's academic achievement. The correspondence of the results was evaluated using multiple criteria.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: It is important for researchers to think carefully about their estimand of interest and use methods appropriate for that estimand. If interest is in drawing inferences to the survey target population, it is important to take the survey weights into account, particularly in the outcome analysis stage for estimating the PATE. The case study shows, however, not much difference among various analysis methods in one applied example.},

Maintaining the clear and accessible style of the previous edition, this book outlines the essential statistical methodsfor survey design and analysis, while also exploring techniques that have developed over the past decade. The Fourth Edition successfully guides the reader through the basic concepts and procedures that accompany real-world sample surveys, such as sampling designs, problems of missing data, statistical analysis of multistage sampling data, and nonresponse and poststratification adjustment procedures. Rather than employ a heavily mathematical approach, the authors present illustrative examples that demonstrate the rationale behind common steps in the sampling process, from creating effective surveys to analyzing collected data. Along with established methods, modern topics are treated through the books new features, which include: A new chapter on telephone sampling, with coverage of declining response rates, the creation of do not call lists, and the growing use of cellular phones A new chapter on sample weighting that focuses on adjustments to weight for nonresponse, frame deficiencies, and the effects of estimator instability An updated discussion of sample survey data analysis that includes analytic procedures for estimation and hypothesis testing A new section on Chromys widely used method of taking probability proportional to size samples with minimum replacement of primary sampling units An expanded index with references on the latest research in the field All of the books examples and exercises can be easily worked out using various software packages including SAS, STATA, and SUDAAN, and an extensive FTP site contains additional data sets. With its comprehensive presentation and wealth of relevant examples, Sampling of Populations, Fourth Edition is an ideal book for courses on survey sampling at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for practicing statisticians who would like to refresh their knowledge of sampling techniques.},

Despite this, defectors often go unpunished, and groups with social structures that are a priori favorable often fail. A critical distinction is required between the structural effect on ability versus willingness to punish. The authors develop a theoretical framework in which variation in a group’s social structure generates a tension between ability and willingness to enforce cooperation. Structures that promote ability to punish also often reduce interest in carrying out sanctions, thus changing collective outcomes. The authors’ empirical analysis involves a well-defined cooperative dilemma: group lending in Sierra Leone. They complement statistical modeling, based on a data set containing 5,487 group repayments, with ethnographic analysis. They find that (1) structural cohesion only increases economic cooperation between borrowers to a point, beyond which unwillingness outweighs increased ability to punish, reducing group repayments, and that (2) groups with disconnected subgroups perform worse on average. Although borrowers are more willing to punish defectors in the out-subgroup, they are unable to do so effectively.},

Our theoretical model identifies guilt aversion in a JL contract and shame aversion under public repayment of loans as the main psychological drivers of effort choice. Evidence from our lab-in-the-field experiment in Pakistan reveals large treatment effects and confirms the central roles of guilt and shame. Under private repayment, a JL contract increases effort by almost 100\% relative to an IL contract. Under public repayment, effort levels are comparable under IL and JL contracts, indicating that shame aversion plays a more important role than guilt aversion. Under IL, public repayment relative to private repayment increases effort by 60\%, confirming our shame-aversion hypothesis. Under JL, the private versus public repayment contrast shows that shame trumps guilt in explaining borrowers’ effort choices.},

The group lending literature typically uses one or few measures of social capital in a linear form, and systematically understates the uncertainty of results and model specifications. As a result, many papers conclude that specific measures of social capital do not matter. This paper introduces Bayesian Model Averaging to the group lending literature and simultaneously tests the validity of six different measures of social capital. While the initial analysis suggests that only few measures matter, this result becomes invalid when using model selection criteria and Bayesian Model Averaging while allowing for nonlinearity and interactions between different aspects of social capital. We find geographical proximity, trust, friendship, group homogeneity, and acquaintanceship to be important factors in explaining group repayment with mixed evidence for relatives. Our results suggest that microfinance institutions should target borrowing groups with more social capital.},

Lenders typically require joint liability, where multiple borrowers share the responsibility of repaying a group loan. We propose that this lending practice creates a cooperation dilemma similar to that faced by humans and other organisms in nature across many domains. This could offer a real-world test case for evolutionary theories of cooperation from the biological sciences. In turn, such theories could provide new insights into loan repayment behaviour. We first hypothesise how group loan repayment efficacy should be affected by mechanisms of assortment from the evolutionary literature on cooperation, i.e. common ancestry (kin selection), prior interaction (reciprocity), partner choice, similarity of tags, social learning, and ecology and demography. We then assess selected hypotheses by reviewing 41 studies from 32 countries on micro-borrowers’ loan repayment, evaluating which characteristics of borrowers are associated with credit repayment behaviour. Surprisingly, we find that kinship is mostly negatively associated with repayment efficacy, but prior interaction and partner choice are both more positively associated. Our work highlights the scope of evolutionary theory to provide systematic insight into how humans respond to novel economic institutions and interventions.},

In a review of the 100 highest-cited cross-national studies of economic development and values, we find that controls for non-independence are rare. When studies do include controls for non-independence, our simulations suggest that commonly used methods continue to produce false positives. In reanalyses of twelve cross-national relationships, we show that half are no longer significant after controlling for non-independence using global proximity matrices. We urge social scientists to sufficiently control for non-independence in cross-national research.},

Theorists have identified competing mechanisms for facilitating group cooperation, including group identity, sanctions and reciprocity. Here I use empirical data to explore how these mechanisms influence cooperation in the natural laboratory of microcredit borrowing groups. Microcredit makes loans to high-risk borrowers through borrowing groups in which individuals' access to credit is dependent on the behavior of other members of the group, thereby creating a social dilemma for members and an opportunity to observe cooperation in real world groups. By analyzing both collective goods production (loans) and compliance (repayment), I find that the competing mechanisms have differential effects. Group identity, sanctions and reciprocity are all associated with more borrowing in the group. Only reciprocity, however, limits loan delinquency and is associated with group longevity, suggesting both that collective goods production is a distinct process from group compliance over time, and that reciprocity may be an important mechanism in both processes. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of group cooperation, as well as the implications for the related theoretical concept of embeddedness.},

The main objective was to shed light on the moral universalism and relativism debate by showing that the answer depends on the moral issues studied. Using items from the Morally Debatable Behaviours Scale (MDBS) fielded in the World Value Survey (WVS), we found that moral issues can be differentiated cross-culturally into attitudes towards (1) dishonest–illegal and (2) personal–sexual issues. Drawing upon evolutionary and cultural theories, we expected that the former moral domain is not related to cultural values, whereas the latter is influenced by cultural conceptions of the self (i.e. independent versus interdependent selves). We used multilevel modelling with Schwartz' cultural values as the independent variables and the two moral domains as assessed through the MDBS as dependent variables to test our hypothesis. After controlling for individual-level differences in moral attitudes as well as the socio-economic development of countries, our findings confirmed that attitudes towards dishonest–illegal issues were not related to cultural values whereas attitudes towards personal–sexual issues were predicted by the Autonomy–Embeddedness value dimension. We conclude that our study sheds not only light on the universalism and relativism debate, but also on the discriminant validity of cultural values. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The aggregate indicators are based on several hundred individual underlying variables, taken from a wide variety of existing data sources. The data reflect the views on governance of survey respondents and public, private, and NGO sector experts worldwide. We also explicitly report margins of error accompanying each country estimate.

We find robust evidence of a negative relationship between religiosity and loan losses in MFIs. We also find that the relationship between religiosity and loan losses is stronger for MFIs in Protestant-dominated countries than in Catholic-dominated countries. Moreover, religiosity improves the operational self-sufficiency of MFIs through a reduction in loan losses. We find that religiosity does not improve the loan repayment behaviour of women borrowers, but it reduces the loan size per borrower. Overall, our evidence suggests that although religiosity reduces loan losses through religiosity-induced lender-risk aversion, it does not improve the loan repayment behaviour of borrowers. We also use several approaches to evaluate our results to the effects of endogeneity.},

The exogenous component of culture due to history is strongly correlated with current regional economic development, after controlling for contemporaneous education, urbanization rates around 1850, and national effects.},

	abstract = {Microfinance is generally associated with high repayment rates. However, it is not clear what drives such high repayment rates? Does the success of microfinance results only from the use of group lending, peer sanctioning or long-term relationships that typically characterize microfinance contracts? In this paper, we aim to contribute to the existing literature by using a laboratory experiment to disentangle the effect of these different potential mechanisms. Our experiment involves both students and real bankers in the role of lenders. We find that group lending alone, in absence of peer sanctioning mechanisms induces free riding and is not sufficient to mitigate the problems of ex ante and ex post moral hazard. In sharp contrast, we find that individualized long-term relationships perform significantly better than either form of group lending with or without peer sanctioning. Consequently, borrowers’ final payoffs are lower in the group lending schemes than in the individual lending scheme due to the fact that borrowers receive on average fewer loans from lenders in the group lending schemes. Our study also sheds light on the social cost of peer pressure mechanisms.},

We use a suitable parameterization of the beta law in terms of its mean and a precision parameter. The parameters of the mixture distribution are modeled as functions of regression parameters.

In virtually all countries, citizens were more likely to return wallets that contained more money. Neither nonexperts nor professional economists were able to predict this result. Additional data suggest that our main findings can be explained by a combination of altruistic concerns and an aversion to viewing oneself as a thief, both of which increase with the material benefits of dishonesty.},

We collect data on 373 MFIs and merge it with country-level economic and institutional data. Evidence arises for complementarity between MFI performance and the broader economy. For example, MFIs are more likely to cover costs when growth is stronger; and MFIs in financially deeper economies have lower default and operating costs, and charge lower interest rates. There is also evidence suggestive of substitutability or rivalry. For example, more manufacturing and higher workforce participation are associated with slower growth in MFI outreach. Overall, the country context appears to be an important determinant of MFI performance; MFI performance should be handicapped for the environment in which it was achieved.},

Hofstede's dimensional concept of culture, to begin with, dominates in cross-cultural psychology and international management. Inglehart's dynamic concept of culture, by contrast, prevails in sociology and political science. We argue that this disciplinary division is unfortunate because the two concepts are complementary, for which reason a synthesis rectifies their mutual weaknesses. Indeed, while Hofstede?s dimensional concept neglects cultural dynamics, Inglehart's dynamic concept is dimensionally reductionist. We demonstrate empirically that combining these two concepts leads to an improved understanding of cultural differences. Inspired by Hofstede's cultural dimensions, we use data from the European Value Studies and World Values Surveys for 495,011 individuals born between 1900 and 1999 in 110 countries and then show that change on these dimensions proceeds as Inglehart and his collaborators suggest. Most notably, younger generations have become more individualistic and more joyous. But even though economic development and generational replacement drive this cultural change, roughly half of the variation in national cultural orientations is unique to each country, due to lasting intercept differences in developmental trajectories that trace back to remote historic drivers. We discuss the implications for cross-national cultural research.},

The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced.

	abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity rates have been rising steeply across the globe in recent decades, posing a major threat to global human health. Despite this almost universal increase, differences between countries remain striking, even among equally developed societies.
Methods: We test if two cultural dimensions derived from a revised Hofstede model of culture from Minkov (2018), namely collectivism vs. individualism and monumentalism vs. flexibility, could help explain national variations in prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30) among women and men around the world. We develop a theo­ retical framework that links these two cultural dimensions with obesity and then test their association empiri­ cally in analyses including 51 countries from all regions of the world as well as using imputed data for a total of 155 countries, representing 98\% of the global population.
Results: In contrast to previous studies, we find that, adjusting for undernourishment and other potential con­ founds, individualism is associated with higher obesity prevalence in the male population, but not among the female population. We explain these findings by pointing to the different mechanisms through which individ­ ualism relates to health behavior, some of which are more gender-specific than others. A further novel finding is that flexibility, a national cultural trait that emphases humility, self-control, and restraint of desires, is a strong negative predictor of obesity in both genders beyond various potential confounds and is highly robust in spec­ ification curve analyses.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that taking national culture into account can enhance our understanding of the obesity pandemic and should thus be considered by policy-makers in their design of interventions.},

Economists have studied the topic intensively, typically taxonomizing discrimination as either taste-based or (accurate) statistical discrimination. To reveal the limitations of this taxonomy and enrich it psychologically, we design a hiring experiment that rules out both of these sources of discrimination with respect to gender. Yet, we still detect substantial discrimination against women. We provide evidence of two forms of discrimination, explicit and implicit belief-based discrimination. Both rely on statistically inaccurate beliefs but differ in how clearly they reveal that the choice was based on gender. Our analysis highlights the central role played by contextual features of the choice setting in determining whether and how discrimination will manifest. We conclude by discussing how policy makers may design effective regulation to address the specific forms of discrimination identified in our experiment.},

	abstract = {Background: Whether Copeptin combined with high sensitivity troponin below the respective decision cut-offs improves rule-out of NSTEMI and may predict all-cause death at 30-day is under debate.
Methods: Data on 10,329 patients from 5 trials were pooled to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic performance of an initial Copeptin below decision cut-off in combination with a (hs)-cTn below the uppler limit of normal (ULN) compared to a) the initial (hs)-cTn alone in the standard serial sampling strategy based on the 99th percentile and b) a single marker strategy (SMS) based on hs-cTn {\textless} limit of detection. Endpoints were sensitivities and negative predictive values (NPV) for rule-out of NSTEMI, 30day all-cause mortality and rates of eligibility for DMS or SMS.
Results: NPV for NSTEMI was higher for DMS than for the initial cTn, regardless assay sensitivity. The highest NPVs were observed with DMS vs. hs-cTn (99.4\% [95\% CI: 99.0\%–99.6\%] vs. 98.8\% [98.4\%–99.1\%],) , and improved performance was consistent across all important subgroups including presentation {\textless}3 h, again irrespective of assay sensitivity. The point estimate of all NPVs for all-cause death exceeded 99.75\%. In the label populations, DMS versus SMS demonstrated comparably high NPVs for rule-out of NSTEMI (99.4\% [99.0\%–99.6\%] vs. 99.9\% [99.2\%–100.0\%]), very low mortality after rule-out (0.1\% [0.0\%–0.4\% vs. 0.0\% [0.0\%–1.2\%]), but eligibility for rule-out was 2.4-fold higher (61.4\% [59.9\%–62.9\%] vs. 25.3\% [23.7\%–26.9\%]) with DMS than SMS.
Conclusion: Findings from a large pooled cohort corroborate the safety of the dual marker strategy for instant rule-out of NSTEMI, extending evidence to hs-cTn. Copeptin below cut-off in combination with hs-cTn below ULN may be used in more than 2.4-times more patients presenting with suspected ACS than a single marker strategy based on very low hs-cTn, without the need to exclude very early presenters or other important subgroups.},

We discuss different alternative measures of heterogeneity and suggest using a median odds ratio measure that is a function of the original random effects parameters. The measure allows a simple interpretation, in terms of well-known odds ratios, that greatly facilitates communication between the data analyst and the subject-matter researcher. Three examples from different subject areas, mainly taken from our own experience, serve to motivate and illustrate different aspects of parameter interpretation in these models.},

In addition to the experiment, which is designed to measure individual propensities to monitor one's peers, we collect a variety of other potential correlates of behaviour and repayment. Controlling for other factors, we find a very strong causal relationship between the average monitoring propensity of a person's loan group and repayment. Our most conservative estimate suggests that borrowers in highly monitored groups are 36\% less likely to have problems repaying their portions of the loan. In addition, confirming previous results, we also find some evidence that risk preferences, social preferences and cognitive skills affect repayment.},

Here we combine longitudinal data and cohort information of nearly 500,000 individuals from 109 nations to track the co-evolution of democratic values and institutions over the last century. We find that cultural values of openness towards diversity predict a shift towards democracy and that nations with low institutional confidence are prone to political instability. In addition, the presence of democratic institutions did not predict any substantive changes in the measured cultural values. These results hold accounting for other factors, including gross domestic product per capita and non-independence between nations due to shared cultural ancestry. Cultural values lead to, rather than follow, the emergence of democracy. This indicates that current stable democracies will be under threat, should cultural values of openness to diversity and institutional confidence substantially decline.},

In this study, the authors use a data science approach to discover a set of quantitative social dimensions based on the World Values Survey, a nationally representative survey covering 60 countries and 90,000 individuals. Five national social dimensions, representing 198 questions and 56 countries are discovered using multidimensional item response theory (MIRT). They are (1) Religiosity, (2) Neutrality, (3) Fairness, (4) Skepticism, and (5) Societal Tranquility. This approach is unique from previous quantitative models because it groups responses by country and analyzes binary, nominal, and ordinal survey questions. It is possible today due to recent advancements in computing power and programming. Furthermore, this methodology tests the validity of previous quantitative dimensions and finds that some of the existing social and cultural dimensions are not clearly discernable. Therefore, this model provides not only more a rigorous methodology but also new social dimensions which more accurately quantify underlying differences across countries in the World Values Survey. Like other quantitative cross-cultural models, this model is a deeply simplified representation of national social differences. However, it is a useful tool for modeling national differences and can be used to help us understand the impacts of social preferences and values on different political, economic, and development variables.},

Yet peer monitoring may also involve particular costs, such as the cost of denouncing wrongdoing, that are larger for group members than for the lender. Moreover, in practice, joint-liability credit often involves monitoring by the lender. To investigate the role of external monitoring and explore the nature of the costs associated with internal group monitoring, we conduct a field experiment in joint-liability credit groups in Burkina Faso. In the experiment, we randomly increase the intensity of external monitoring in credit groups. We find that external monitoring crowds out monitoring by the group leader, causes loan renewal decisions to be more severe and the handling of individual default to be more state-dependent. In addition, increased external monitoring decreases favoritism towards members of the leader’s family. We argue that external monitoring reduces the costs of “pointing fingers” at moral-hazardous behaviors and of sanctioning.},

This model employs the cut point technique popularized by ordered logit to fit a single linear model to both continuous (0,1) and degenerate [0,1] responses. The model can be estimated with or without observations at the bounds, and as such is a general solution for these types of data. Employing a Monte Carlo simulation, I show that the model is noticeably more efficient than ordinary least squares regression, zero-and-one-inflated Beta regression, rescaled Beta regression, and fractional logit while fully capturing nuances in the outcome. I apply the model to a replication of the Aidt and Jensen (2014, European Economic Review 72, 52–75) study of suffrage extensions in Europe.

Defining an appropriate risk threshold to recommend intervention is a key challenge in bringing a risk prediction model to clinical application; such risk thresholds are often defined in an ad hoc way. This is problematic because tacitly assumed costs of false positive and false negative classifications may not be clinically sensible. For example, when choosing the risk threshold that maximizes the proportion of patients correctly classified, false positives and false negatives are assumed equally costly. Furthermore, small to moderate sample sizes may lead to unstable optimal thresholds, which requires a particularly cautious interpretation of results.},

	abstract = {Background
Preeclampsia presents a highly prevalent burden on pregnant women with an estimated incidence of 2\% to 5\%. Preeclampsia increases the maternal risk of death 20-fold and is one of the main causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Novel biomarkers, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor in addition to a wide span of conventional clinical data (medical history, physical symptoms, laboratory parameters, etc.), present an excellent basis for the application of early-detection machine-learning models.
Objective
This study aimed to develop, train, and test an automated machine-learning model for the prediction of adverse outcomes in patients with suspected preeclampsia.
Study Design
Our real-world dataset of 1647 (2472 samples) women was retrospectively recruited from women who presented to the Department of Obstetrics at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany, between July 2010 and March 2019. After standardization and data cleaning, we calculated additional features regarding the biomarkers soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and placental growth factor and sonography data (umbilical artery pulsatility index, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index, mean uterine artery pulsatility index), resulting in a total of 114 features. The target metric was the occurrence of adverse outcomes throughout the remaining pregnancy and 2 weeks after delivery. We trained 2 different models, a gradient-boosted tree and a random forest classifier. Hyperparameter training was performed using a grid search approach. All results were evaluated via a 10 × 10-fold cross-validation regimen.
Results
We obtained metrics for the 2 naive machine-learning models. A gradient-boosted tree model was performed with a positive predictive value of 88\%±6\%, a negative predictive value of 89\%±3\%, a sensitivity of 66\%±5\%, a specificity of 97\%±2\%, an overall accuracy of 89\%±3\%, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82±0.03, an F1 score of 0.76±0.04, and a threat score of 0.61±0.05. The random forest classifier returned an equal positive predictive value (88\%±6\%) and specificity (97\%±1\%) while performing slightly inferior on the other available metrics. Applying differential cutoffs instead of a naive cutoff for positive prediction at ≥0.5 for the classifier’s results yielded additional increases in performance.
Conclusion
Machine-learning techniques were a valid approach to improve the prediction of adverse outcomes in pregnant women at high risk of preeclampsia vs current clinical standard techniques. Furthermore, we presented an automated system that did not rely on manual tuning or adjustments.},

Due to a lack of a causative therapy, an accurate prediction of women at risk for the disease and its associated adverse outcomes is of utmost importance to tailor care. In the past two decades, there have been successful improvements in screening as well as in the prediction of the disease in high-risk women. This is due to, among other things, the introduction of biomarkers such as the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. Recently, the traditional definition of preeclampsia has been expanded based on new insights into the pathophysiology and conclusive evidence on the ability of angiogenic biomarkers to improve detection of preeclampsia-associated maternal and fetal adverse events.},

Our review of over 100 papers using MLM in political science, education, and sociology show that these “known” concerns have been widely ignored in practice. We describe how to debias MLM’s coefficient estimates, and provide an option to more flexibly estimate their standard errors. Most illuminating, once MLMs are adjusted in these two ways the point estimate and standard error for the target coefficient are exactly equal to those of the analogous FE model with cluster-robust standard errors. For investigators working with observational data and who are interested only in inference on the target coefficient, either approach is equally appropriate and preferable to uncorrected MLM.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The objective of this study was to compare performance of logistic regression (LR) with machine learning (ML) for clinical prediction modeling in the literature.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a Medline literature search (1/2016 to 8/2017) and extracted comparisons between LR and ML models for binary outcomes.
Results
We included 71 of 927 studies. The median sample size was 1,250 (range 72–3,994,872), with 19 predictors considered (range 5–563) and eight events per predictor (range 0.3–6,697). The most common ML methods were classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. In 48 (68\%) studies, we observed potential bias in the validation procedures. Sixty-four (90\%) studies used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess discrimination. Calibration was not addressed in 56 (79\%) studies. We identified 282 comparisons between an LR and ML model (AUC range, 0.52–0.99). For 145 comparisons at low risk of bias, the difference in logit(AUC) between LR and ML was 0.00 (95\% confidence interval, −0.18 to 0.18). For 137 comparisons at high risk of bias, logit(AUC) was 0.34 (0.20–0.47) higher for ML.
Conclusion
We found no evidence of superior performance of ML over LR. Improvements in methodology and reporting are needed for studies that compare modeling algorithms.},

	abstract = {Serious illness conversations (SICs) between oncology clinicians and patients are associated with improved quality of life and may reduce aggressive end-of-life care. However, most patients with cancer die without a documented SIC.To test the impact of behavioral nudges to clinicians to prompt SICs on the SIC rate and end-of-life outcomes among patients at high risk of death within 180 days (high-risk patients) as identified by a machine learning algorithm.This prespecified 40-week analysis of a stepped-wedge randomized clinical trial conducted between June 17, 2019, and April 20, 2020 (including 16 weeks of intervention rollout and 24 weeks of follow-up), included 20 506 patients with cancer representing 41 021 encounters at 9 tertiary or community-based medical oncology clinics in a large academic health system. The current analyses were conducted from June 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022.High-risk patients were identified using a validated electronic health record machine learning algorithm to predict 6-month mortality. The intervention consisted of (1) weekly emails to clinicians comparing their SIC rates for all patients against peers’ rates, (2) weekly lists of high-risk patients, and (3) opt-out text messages to prompt SICs before encounters with high-risk patients.The primary outcome was SIC rates for all and high-risk patient encounters; secondary end-of-life outcomes among decedents included inpatient death, hospice enrollment and length of stay, and intensive care unit admission and systemic therapy close to death. Intention-to-treat analyses were adjusted for clinic and wedge fixed effects and clustered at the oncologist level.The study included 20 506 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [14.0] years) and 41 021 patient encounters: 22 259 (54\%) encounters with female patients, 28 907 (70.5\%) with non-Hispanic White patients, and 5520 (13.5\%) with high-risk patients; 1417 patients (6.9\%) died by the end of follow-up. There were no meaningful differences in demographic characteristics in the control and intervention periods. Among high-risk patient encounters, the unadjusted SIC rates were 3.4\% (59 of 1754 encounters) in the control period and 13.5\% (510 of 3765 encounters) in the intervention period. In adjusted analyses, the intervention was associated with increased SICs for all patients (adjusted odds ratio, 2.09 [95\% CI, 1.53-2.87]; P \&lt; .001) and decreased end-of-life systemic therapy (7.5\% [72 of 957 patients] vs 10.4\% [24 of 231 patients]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.25 [95\% CI, 0.11-0.57]; P = .001) relative to controls, but there was no effect on hospice enrollment or length of stay, inpatient death, or end-of-life ICU use.In this randomized clinical trial, a machine learning–based behavioral intervention and behavioral nudges to clinicans led to an increase in SICs and reduction in end-of-life systemic therapy but no changes in other end-of-life outcomes among outpatients with cancer. These results suggest that machine learning and behavioral nudges can lead to long-lasting improvements in cancer care delivery.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03984773},

	abstract = {Missing data pose challenges to real-life data analysis. Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.

This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field.
This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader’s intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.},

We implement the procedure to study beliefs about men's and women's performance on a math task and their choices in the ultimatum game. In the math task, 71\% of participants believe that most men believe men outscore women. In contrast, 34\% believe that most women believe men outscore women. Despite these differences in second-order beliefs with respect to math ability, we observe no such difference in first-order beliefs. On the other hand, we find no difference in participants’ beliefs about men's and women's beliefs with respect to choices in the ultimatum game, which is consistent with our observation of no difference in first-order beliefs.

	abstract = {Recent decades have seen a rise in religious nationalism around the world, and Japan is no exception. As highlighted in the lead chapter by Koichi Nakano, over the past two decades there has been a significant rightward shift in Japanese politics. This trend is closely related to organized religion and its affiliated political efforts to reshape various dimensions of Japanese society. When the topic of religion and politics is referred to in the Japanese context, it is usually in relation to Sōka Gakkai and Kōmeitō. It is well known that Sōka Gakkai, the largest Buddhist new religion in postwar Japan, was not content to cultivate the piety of its followers in the private sphere, but formed its own political party, the Kōmeitō, with a vision of shaping public life according to its principles and ideals. Sōka Gakkai’s political engagement has been the focus of considerable criticism and public debate, as well as scholarly research.1},

Although sample size calculations for testing parameters in a Poisson regression model with prespecified power and size have been previously done, very little attention has been paid to this problem for the hierarchical model. We propose to use Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the sample size necessary to perform the Wald tests when the number of clusters is fixed in advance, but the cluster size is variable. The effect of the number of clusters and the covariance structure of the fixed effects is also studied. The method and the simulation study are also extended to the case of the hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson regression model in order to obtain analogous results there. The method is also illustrated on an interesting real dataset.},

	abstract = {‘Will my study answer my research question?’ is the most fundamental question a researcher can ask when designing a study, yet when phrased in statistical terms – ‘What is the power of my study?’ or ‘How precise will my parameter estimate be?’ – few researchers in ecology and evolution (EE) try to answer it, despite the detrimental consequences of performing under- or over-powered research. We suggest that this reluctance is due in large part to the unsuitability of simple methods of power analysis (broadly defined as any attempt to quantify prospectively the ‘informativeness’ of a study) for the complex models commonly used in EE research. With the aim of encouraging the use of power analysis, we present simulation from generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) as a flexible and accessible approach to power analysis that can account for random effects, overdispersion and diverse response distributions. We illustrate the benefits of simulation-based power analysis in two research scenarios: estimating the precision of a survey to estimate tick burdens on grouse chicks and estimating the power of a trial to compare the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in malaria mosquito control. We provide a freely available R function, sim.glmm, for simulating from GLMMs. Analysis of simulated data revealed that the effects of accounting for realistic levels of random effects and overdispersion on power and precision estimates were substantial, with correspondingly severe implications for study design in the form of up to fivefold increases in sampling effort. We also show the utility of simulations for identifying scenarios where GLMM-fitting methods can perform poorly. These results illustrate the inadequacy of standard analytical power analysis methods and the flexibility of simulation-based power analysis for GLMMs. The wider use of these methods should contribute to improving the quality of study design in EE.},

Two appendices describe the required matrix algebra, as well as elements of probability calculus and statistical inference.In this substantially revised and updated new edition the overview on regression models has been extended, and now includes the relation between regression models and machine learning, additional details on statistical inference in structured additive regression models have been added and a completely reworked chapter augments the presentation of quantile regression with a comprehensive introduction to distributional regression models. Regularization approaches are now more extensively discussed in most chapters of the book.The book primarily targets an audience that includes students, teachers and practitioners in social, economic, and life sciences, as well as students and teachers in statistics programs, and mathematicians and computer scientists with interests in statistical modeling and data analysis.

We empirically examine whether exposure to markets is associated with lower levels of civic morality, i.e. the responsibility and respect of the individual towards society's rules and the public good. Because most prior research lacks generalizability, we scrutinize the relationship between markets and individuals’ civic morality in a large set of highly culturally and institutionally diverse countries and regions. Multilevel analyses of cross-country individual-level survey data indicate a robust positive relationship between market exposure and civic morality. We find that subnational regions and countries experiencing an increase in market activity also experience an increase in individuals’ civic morality. Our results suggest that the mechanism behind this relation works through the fairness of the market process. We conclude that there is no empirical evidence suggesting that markets undermine civic morality.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

	abstract = {When working with grouped data, investigators may choose between “fixed effects” models (FE) with specialized (e.g., cluster-robust) standard errors, or “multilevel models” (MLMs) employing “random effects.” We review the claims given in published works regarding this choice, then clarify how these approaches work and compare by showing that: (i) random effects employed in MLMs are simply “regularized” fixed effects; (ii) unmodified MLMs are consequently susceptible to bias—but there is a longstanding remedy; and (iii) the “default” MLM standard errors rely on narrow assumptions that can lead to undercoverage in many settings. Our review of over 100 papers using MLM in political science, education, and sociology show that these “known” concerns have been widely ignored in practice. We describe how to debias MLM’s coefficient estimates, and provide an option to more flexibly estimate their standard errors. Most illuminating, once MLMs are adjusted in these two ways the point estimate and standard error for the target coefficient are exactly equal to those of the analogous FE model with cluster-robust standard errors. For investigators working with observational data and who are interested only in inference on the target coefficient, either approach is equally appropriate and preferable to uncorrected MLM.},

In particular, the coevolution of new sequencing platforms and new software tools allows data acquisition and analysis on an unprecedented scale. Here we report the next stage in this coevolutionary arms race, using the Illumina GAIIx platform to sequence a diverse array of 25 environmental samples and three known "mock communities" at a depth averaging 3.1 million reads per sample. We demonstrate excellent consistency in taxonomic recovery and recapture diversity patterns that were previously reported on the basis of metaanalysis of many studies from the literature (notably, the saline/nonsaline split in environmental samples and the split between host-associated and free-living communities). We also demonstrate that 2,000 Illumina single-end reads are sufficient to recapture the same relationships among samples that we observe with the full dataset. The results thus open up the possibility of conducting large-scale studies analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously to survey microbial communities at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.},

It is first shown how correspondence analysis can be used to interpret a simple cross-tabulation by visualizing the table in the form of a map of points representing the rows and columns of the table. Combinations of variables can also be interpreted by coding the data in the appropriate way. The technique can also be used to deduce optimal scale values for the levels of a categorical variable, thus giving quantitative meaning to the categories. Multiple correspondence analysis can analyze several categorical variables simultaneously, and is analogous to factor analysis of continuous variables. Other uses of correspondence analysis are illustrated using different variables of the same Spanish database: for example, exploring patterns of missing data and visualizing trends across surveys from consecutive years.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the PCA model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. PCA can be generalized as correspondence analysis (CA) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (MFA) in order to handle heterogeneous sets of variables. Mathematically, PCA depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (SVD) of rectangular matrices.

It’s also important to consider the power of the trial to detect true intervention effects.

	abstract = {Clustered or correlated samples of binary responses arise frequently in practice due to repeated measurements or to subsampling the primary sampling units. Several recent approaches address intracluster correlation in binary regression problems including cluster-specific methods such as those based on mixed-effects logistic models and population-averaged methods such as those based on beta-binomial models. This paper considers the interpretations of the regression parameters in these two general approaches. We show that, unlike models for correlated Gaussian outcomes, the parameters of the cluster-specific and population-averaged models for correlated binary data describe different types of effects of the covariates on the response probabilities. In the case of random intercepts, we show that the covariate effects measured by the population-averaged approach are closer to zero than those of the cluster-specific approach when the cluster-specific model holds and that the difference in the magnitude of the covariate effects is increasing with intra-cluster correlation. The case of random slopes is also examined. These results are valid for arbitrary random effects distributions and are demonstrated using data on the ability to obtain samples of breast fluid from women. /// Des échantillons corrélés ou en grappes de réponses binaire se présentent fréquemment en pratique à cause de mesures répétées ou de sous-échantillonage d'échantillons initiaux. La corrélation intra-grappe dans les problèmes de régression binaires a été l'objet d'études et méthodes récentes. On peut citer les méthodes spécifiques aux grappes telles que celles basées sur les modèles logistiques à effets mixtes ainsi que les méthodes de moyennes de populations telles que celles basées sur les modèles bêta-binomiaux. Notre article considère l'interprétation des paramètres de régression dans ces méthods générales. Nous démontrons que, contrairement à ce qui se passe pour des résultats Gaussiens corrélés, pour des données binaires corrélées les paramètres spécifique aux grappes et ceux des modèles de moyennes de populations décrivent différents types d'effet des covariables sur les probabilités de réponse. Dans le cas des valeurs à zéro aléatories, nous démontrons que si la modèle des grappes est verifié, mesurer l'effet des covariables par la méthode des moyennes de populations donne des résultats plus proches de zéro que si l'on mesure par les méthodes spécifiques aux grappes. On démontre aussi que la différence entre les résultats des deux méthodes augmente avec la corrélation intra-grappe. Nous étudions aussi le cas des pentes aléatories. Ces résultats s'appliquent à toute distribution des effets aléatoires. On le décrit pour des données sur la capacité d'obtenir des échantillons de liquide mammaire.},

	abstract = {Quantile regression, as a generalization of median regression, has been widely used in statistical modeling. To allow for analyzing complex data situations, several flexible regression models have been introduced. Among these are the varying coefficient models, that differ from a classical linear regression model by the fact that the regression coefficients are no longer constant but functions that vary with the value taken by another variable, such as for example, time. In this paper, we study quantile regression in varying coefficient models for longitudinal data. The quantile function is modeled as a function of the covariates and the main task is to estimate the unknown regression coefficient functions. We approximate each coefficient function by means of P-splines. Theoretical properties of the estimators, such as rate of convergence and an asymptotic distribution are established. The estimation methodology requests solving an optimization problem that also involves a smoothing parameter. For a special case the optimization problem can be transformed into a linear programming problem for which then a Frisch–Newton interior point method is used, leading to a computationally fast and efficient procedure. Several data-driven choices of the smoothing parameters are briefly discussed, and their performances are illustrated in a simulation study. Some real data analysis demonstrates the use of the developed method.},

	abstract = {The analysis of repeated measures or panel data allows control of some of the biases which plague other observational studies, particularly unmeasured confounding. When this bias is suspected, and the research question is: ‘Does a change in an exposure cause a change in the outcome?’, a fixed effects approach can reduce the impact of confounding by time-invariant factors, such as the unmeasured characteristics of individuals. Epidemiologists familiar with using mixed models may initially presume that specifying a random effect (intercept) for every individual in the study is an appropriate method. However, this method uses information from both the within-individual/unit exposure-outcome association and the between-individual/unit exposure-outcome association. Variation between individuals may introduce confounding bias into mixed model estimates, if unmeasured time-invariant factors are associated with both the exposure and the outcome. Fixed effects estimators rely only on variation within individuals and hence are not affected by confounding from unmeasured time-invariant factors. The reduction in bias using a fixed effects model may come at the expense of precision, particularly if there is little change in exposures over time. Neither fixed effects nor mixed models control for unmeasured time-varying confounding or reverse causation.},

	abstract = {Local least squares kernel regression provides an appealing solution to the nonparametric regression, or "scatterplot smoothing," problem, as demonstrated by Fan, for example. The practical implementation of any scatterplot smoother is greatly enhanced by the availability of a reliable rule for automatic selection of the smoothing parameter. In this article we apply the ideas of plug-in bandwidth selection to develop strategies for choosing the smoothing parameter of local linear squares kernel estimators. Our results are applicable to odd-degree local polynomial fits and can be extended to other settings, such as derivative estimation and multiple nonparametric regression. An implementation in the important case of local linear fits with univariate predictors is shown to perform well in practice. A by-product of our work is the development of a class of nonparametric variance estimators, based on local least squares ideas, and plug-in rules for their implementation.},

We find that Out-group trust is positively and significantly associated with bank lending. A closer look shows that this effect only holds in countries with relatively lower levels of formal institutional and judicial development. As for In-group trust, we find that its influence on bank lending is dependent on the level of informal lending available in each country. Overall, this paper provides novel evidence on the importance of trust and the different mechanisms by which it influences bank lending around the world.},

Its central argument is that gender stereotypes give rise to biased judgments and decisions, impeding women's advancement. The paper discusses how descriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias because of the negative performance expectations that result from the perception that there is a poor fit between what women are like and the attributes believed necessary for successful performance in male gender-typed positions and roles. It also discusses how prescriptive gender stereotypes promote gender bias by creating normative standards for behavior that induce disapproval and social penalties when they are directly violated or when violation is inferred because a woman is successful. Research is presented that tests these ideas, considers specific career consequences likely to result from stereotype-based bias, and identifies conditions that exaggerate or minimize the likelihood of their occurrence.},

The social-ecological system (SES) framework investigated in this special issue enables researchers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds working on different resource sectors in disparate geographic areas, biophysical conditions, and temporal domains to share a common vocabulary for the construction and testing of alternative theories and models that determine which influences on processes and outcomes are especially critical in specific empirical settings. We summarize changes that have been made to this framework and discuss a few remaining ambiguities in its formulation. Specifically, we offer a tentative rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts; the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served as the basis for the theoretical innovations and empirical analyses detailed in other contributions to this special issue.},

	abstract = {A growing literature examines the effects of poverty, inequality and polarization on civil war but analyses typically use spatially aggregated data. Many civil wars exhibit great spatial heterogeneity so very local effects may be obscured. We study Nepal’s civil war that escalated sharply from 2001 to contribute evidence on these local effects. We combine geo-coded data on 15 000 conflict deaths spread over a decade with small-area estimates of poverty and inequality for almost 4000 localities in Nepal. We model the likelihood of a locality being affected by conflict and the intensity of the conflict, in terms of the number of deaths. Higher local poverty rates are negatively related to an increased risk of conflict and deaths, due to a shift in strategy by the rebels to target richer middle class and urban areas for accessing resources to win the war. Local relative wealth inequality is postively associated with the escalation of conflict, suggesting that relative wellbeing affects decisions about rebellion and conflict. Caste polarization also raises conflict risk and deaths, especially where dominant caste groups were more numerous. These support an agnostic view that poverty is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the escalation of civil conflict. The strategy used by the rebels in Nepal saw the conflict escalate away from poor areas even as conflict was more likely in unequal and caste-polarized areas.},

	abstract = {Item Response Theory (IRT) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons' responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective prespecified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. We demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and post-processed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.},

In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models.

	abstract = {Background
Since 2005 all German hospitals are obliged to publish structured quality reports (QR). International studies suggest that mandatory reporting motivates hospitals to improve the quality of care. We examine whether such an effect can be demonstrated for hospitals in Germany and whether differences exist between for-profit and non-profit hospitals.
Method
The study was designed as a controlled pre-post intervention study, whereby the intervention consisted in the first notification of the obligation to publish values for clinical quality indicators (QI). The data basis consisted of those QI reported in identical manner from 2006 to 2012 and multivariable statistical analyses were performed. QI from the same clinical area but without reporting obligation in 2006, served as control group.
Results
Six QI were included in the intervention group and demonstrated significant quality improvement. The major part of improvements occurred immediately after the intervention. 31 QI were included in the control group, with about 60\% showing improvement trends. In comparison, the biggest proportional improvements were registered for publicly reported QI. No significant differences in relation to profit orientation were found.
Conclusion
Results indicate a positive effect of public reporting on hospital care, independent of a hospital's profit orientation. Improvements in the quality of care were registered for all observed QI over time, but public reporting stimulated an accelerated QI improvement.},

	abstract = {In Germany, the use of quality data to support hospital capacity planning was introduced in 2017. On behalf of the Federal Joint Committee, IQTIG suggested 11 quality indicators and developed a program on how to collect, evaluate and report data for the clinical areas gynaecological surgery, obstetrics and breast surgery. By analysing data from 2015 to 2021, effects of the introduction of the program on indicator results, statistical discrepancies and impact on care quality are examined. Effects on capacity planning are discussed. Since the program started, indicator results improved in all clinical areas, and statistical discrepancies and the number of assessments with insufficient quality decreased due to enhanced adherence to quality standards and data validity. Effects on capacity planning or the allocation of hospitals have not occurred. Thus, a change of the legal basis to allow a better link between quality and hospital planning is recommended. The approach to use quality data on hospital regulation in Germany is evolving. The current hospital reform in Germany also addresses other approaches to quality-based regulation. Already now, there have been clear improvements in specific indicators as well as lessons for quality assurance and its link to capacity planning provided by the program, which are also applicable to other countries.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies and compare regression- and matching-based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders.
DATA SOURCES: We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time-invariant covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome, time-varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time-varying covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity.
STUDY DESIGN: We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques.
DATA COLLECTION: Simulation code is provided for replication.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Confounders in difference-in-differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time-varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time-varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference-in-differences is difficult.
CONCLUSIONS: Confounding in difference-in-differences is more complicated than in cross-sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time-varying and those with time-varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies.},

The estimand is the target quantity—the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis—the theoretical estimand—in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to theory.},

In addition to covering the case of common treatment timing, I allow for staggered interventions, with and without covariates. Under an index version of parallel trends, I show that average treatment effects on the treated (ATTs) are identified for each cohort and calendar time period in which a cohort was subjected to the intervention. The pooled quasi-maximum likelihood estimators (QMLEs) in the linear exponential family (LEF) extend the pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) estimation in Wooldridge (2021). By using the conditional mean associated with the canonical link function, imputation and estimation pooled across the entire sample produce identical results. Moreover, using the canonical link results in very simple computation of the ATTs and their standard errors. The leading cases are a logit functional form for binary and fractional outcomes, combined with the Bernoulli quasi-log likelihood (QLL), and an exponential mean combined with the Poisson QLL. A small simulation study shows the estimators work well when the mean function is correctly specified; they also have some resiliency to misspecification.},

Despite varying widely—from tobacco taxes to poverty-relief programs—such policies present a common dilemma to public health researchers: how to evaluate their health effects when randomized controlled trials are not possible. Here, we review the state of knowledge and experience of public health researchers who rigorously evaluate the health consequences of large-scale public policy changes. We organize our discussion by detailing approaches to address three common challenges of conducting policy evaluations: distinguishing a policy effect from time trends in health outcomes or preexisting differences between policy-affected and -unaffected communities (using difference-in-differences approaches); constructing a comparison population when a policy affects a population for whom a well-matched comparator is not immediately available (using propensity score or synthetic control approaches); and addressing unobserved confounders by utilizing quasi-random variations in policy exposure (using regression discontinuity, instrumental variables, or near-far matching approaches).},

However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method's assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

	abstract = {Policy Points: Similarities and disparities between countries and initiatives are identified. Measuring, reporting, and rewarding quality is heavily focused on process measures. Hospital-level benchmarking is not always available publicly. Quality-related payment schemes vary widely, with several countries only piloting small-scale initiatives. To increase quality accountability, the government has to set standards and incentives. The right balance between system centralization and decentralization has to be struck. Accountability needs to be based on outcomes, not process measures, and focus should be on hospital and medical condition levels. Providers have a central role as quality accountability advocates. Context Studies have documented wide quality variation among hospitals within and across countries. Increasing quality-of-care accountability for hospitals, especially for patients and the general public, is an important policy objective, but no study has yet systematically and comprehensively compared leading countries’ initiatives in this regard. Methods Based on expert interviews and an extensive literature review, we investigate hospital quality accountability in England, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. The underlying framework includes 3 elements: measuring quality, reporting quality, and rewarding quality. Each element is subdivided into 2 dimensions, with measuring composed of indicator type and data source, reporting composed of degree of reporting centralization and data accessibility, and rewarding composed of extent of application and type of quality-related payments. Findings The results show a wide spectrum of approaches and progress levels. Measuring strategies are more similar across countries, while quality reporting and financial rewards are more dissimilar. Reporting of process indicators is more prevalent than reporting of outcomes. Most countries have introduced some quality-related payment schemes, with the United States having the most comprehensive approach. Based on the cross-country assessment, 5 policy levers to enhance quality transparency are identified and illustrated through country-specific examples: (1) the government should take a central role in establishing standards and incentives for quality transparency and health IT system integration; (2) system centralization and decentralization need to be balanced to ensure both national comparability and local innovation; (3) health systems need to focus more on outcome transparency and less on process measures; (4) health systems need to engage providers as proponents of quality transparency; and (5) reporting should focus on hospital and condition levels to ensure comparability and enable meaningful patient choice. Conclusions The findings facilitate cross-country learning and best-practice adoption by assessing hospital quality accountability strategies in 5 countries in a structured and comparative manner. The identified policy levers are relevant for enhancing breadth, depth, and value of quality accountability.},

	abstract = {\&amp;lt;p\&amp;gt;Item response theory (IRT) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons’ responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.\&amp;lt;/p\&amp;gt;},

	abstract = {Objective To define confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies and compare regression- and matching-based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders. Data sources We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time-invariant covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome, time-varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time-varying covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity. Study design We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques. Data collection Simulation code is provided for replication. Principal findings Confounders in difference-in-differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time-varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time-varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference-in-differences is difficult. Conclusions Confounding in difference-in-differences is more complicated than in cross-sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time-varying and those with time-varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies.},

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.},

In the present study, we present an analysis of global cropland area change for the first two decades of the twenty-first century derived from satellite data time-series. We estimate that, in 2019, the cropland area was 1,244 Mha with a corresponding total annual net primary production (NPP) of 5.5 Pg C year−1. From 2003 to 2019, cropland area increased by 9\% and cropland NPP by 25\%, primarily due to agricultural expansion in Africa and South America. Global cropland expansion accelerated over the past two decades, with a near doubling of the annual expansion rate, most notably in Africa. Half of the new cropland area (49\%) replaced natural vegetation and tree cover, indicating a conflict with the sustainability goal of protecting terrestrial ecosystems. From 2003 to 2019, global per-capita cropland area decreased by 10\% due to population growth. However, the per-capita annual cropland NPP increased by 3.5\% as a result of intensified agricultural land use. The presented global, high-resolution, cropland map time-series supports monitoring of natural land appropriation at the local, national and international levels.},
